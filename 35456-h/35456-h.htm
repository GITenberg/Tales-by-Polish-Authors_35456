<h2>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</h2>


<p>Of the contemporary Polish authors represented
in this volume only Henryk Sienkiewicz is well
known in England. Although the works of Stefan
Żeromski, Adam Szymański, and Wacław Sieroszewski
are widely read in Poland, none have as
yet appeared in English, so far as the present
translator is aware. 'Srul&mdash;from Lubartów' is
generally considered one of the most striking
of Adam Szymański's Siberian 'Sketches.' The
author writes from personal experience, having
himself been banished to Siberia for a number
of years. The same can be said of Wacław
Sieroszewski; during the fifteen years spent in
Siberia as a political exile, he made a study of
some of the native tribes, especially the Yakut
and Tungus, and has written a great deal on this
subject. Stefan Żeromski is also one of the most
distinguished modern Polish novelists; several of
his books have been translated into French and
German.</p>

<p>The translator is under a deep obligation to
the authors, MM. Sienkiewicz, Szymański, and
Żeromski, for kindly allowing her to publish these
tales in English, and to Mr. J. H. Retinger,
Secretary of the Polish Bureau in London, for
authorising the same on behalf of M. Sieroszewski.</p>

<h2>BARTEK THE CONQUEROR</h2>

<h3>HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ</h3>





<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>My hero's name was Bartek Słowik<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; but
owing to his habit of staring when spoken
to, the neighbours called him 'Bartek Goggle-Eyes.'
Indeed, he had little in common with
nightingales, and his intellectual qualities and
truly childish <i>naïveté</i> won him the further nickname
of 'Bartek the Blockhead.' This last was
the most popular, in fact, the only one handed
down to history, though Bartek bore yet a fourth,&mdash;an
official&mdash;name. Since the Polish words
'man' and 'nightingale'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> present no difference
to a German ear, and the Germans love to translate
Barbarian Proper names into a more cultured
language in the cause of civilization, the following
conversation took place when he was being
entered as a recruit.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' the officer asked Bartek.</p>

<p>'Słowik.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>'Szloik<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>Ach, ja, gut.</i>'</p>

<p>And the officer wrote down 'Man.'</p>

<p>Bartek came from the village of Pognębin, a
name given to a great many villages in the
Province of Posen and in other parts of Poland.
First of all there was he himself, not to mention
his land, his cottage and two cows, his own
piebald horse, and his wife, Magda. Thanks to
this combination of circumstances he was able to
live comfortably, and according to the maxim
contained in the verse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">To him whom God would bless He gives, of course,</span><br />
<span class="i2">A wife called Magda and a piebald horse.</span><br />
</div>

<p>In fact, all his life he had taken whatever
Providence sent without troubling about it. But
just now Providence had ordained war, and Bartek
was not a little upset at this. For news had
come that the Reserves would be called up, and
that it would be necessary to leave his cottage
and land, and entrust it all to his wife's care.
People at Pognębin were poor enough already.
Bartek usually worked at the factory in the winter
and helped his household on in this way;&mdash;but
what would happen now? Who could know
when the war with the French would end?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Magda, when she had read through the papers,
began to swear:</p>

<p>'May they be damned and die themselves!
May they be blinded!&mdash;Though you are a fool&mdash;yet
I am sorry for you. The French give no
quarter; they will chop off your head, I dare say.'</p>

<p>Bartek felt that his wife spoke the truth. He
feared the French like fire, and was sorry for
himself on this account. What had the French
done to him? What was he going after there,&mdash;why
was he going to that horrible strange land
where not a single friendly soul was to be found?
He knew what life at Pognębin was like,&mdash;well,
it was neither easy nor difficult, but just such as
it was. But now he was being told to go away,
although he knew that it was better to be here
than anywhere else. Still, there was no help for
it;&mdash;such is fate. Bartek embraced his wife, and
the ten-year old Franek; spat, crossed himself,
and went out of the cottage, Magda following
him. They did not take very tender leave of one
another. They both sobbed, he repeating, 'Come,
come, hush!' and went out into the road. There
they realized that the same thing which had
happened to them had happened to all Pognębin,
for the whole village was astir, and the road was
obstructed by traffic. As they walked to the
station, women, children, old men and dogs
followed them. Everyone's heart was heavy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
but a few smoked their pipes with an air of
indifference, and some were already intoxicated.
Others were singing with hoarse voices:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'Skrzynecki<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> died, alas!</span><br />
<span class="i2">No more his voice is heard;</span><br />
<span class="i2">His hand, bedeckt with rings,</span><br />
<span class="i2">No more shall wield the sword,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>while one or two of the Germans from Pognębin
sang 'Die Wacht am Rhein' out of sheer fright.
All that motley and many-coloured crowd,&mdash;including
policemen with glittering bayonets,&mdash;moved
in file towards the end of the village with
shouts, bustle, and confusion. Women clung to
their 'warriors′' necks and wept; one old
woman showed her yellow teeth and waved her
arms in the air; another cried: 'May the Lord
remember our tears!' There were cries of:
'Franek! Kaśka! Józek! good-bye!' Dogs
barked, the church bell rang, the priest even said
the prayers for the dying, since not one of those
now going to the station would return. The war
had claimed them all, but the war would not give
them back. The plough would grow rusty in the
field, for Pognębin had declared war against the
French. Pognębin could not acquiesce in the
supremacy of Napoleon III, and took to heart the
question of the Spanish succession. The last
sounds of the bell hovered over the crowd, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

was already falling out of line. Heads were
bared as they passed the shrine. The light dust
rose up from the road, for the day was dry and
fine. Along both sides of the road the ripening
corn, heavy in the ear, rustled and bowed in the
gentle gusts of wind. The larks were twittering
in the blue sky, and each warbled as if fearing he
might be forgotten.</p>

<p>At the station there was a still greater crowd,
and more noise and confusion! Here were men
called in from Krzywda Gorna, Krzywda Dolna,
from Wywłaszczyniec, from Niedola, and Mizerów.
The station walls were covered with proclamations
in which war was declared in the Name
of God and the Fatherland: the 'Landwehr'
was setting forth to defend menaced parents,
wives and children, cottages and fields. It was
evident that the French bore a special grudge
against Pognębin, Krzywda Gorna, Krzywda
Dolna, Wywłaszczyniec, Niedola, and Mizerów.
Such, at least, was the impression produced on
those who read the placards. Fresh crowds were
continually assembling in front of the station. In
the waiting-room the smoke from the men's pipes
filled the air, and hid the placards. It was difficult
to make oneself understood in the noise, for
everyone was running, shouting, and screaming.
On the platform orders were given in German.
They sounded strangely brief, harsh, and decisive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The bell rang. The powerful breath of the
engine was heard in the distance coming nearer,&mdash;growing
more distinct. With it the war itself
seemed to be coming nearer.</p>

<p>A second bell,&mdash;and a shudder ran through
every heart. A woman began to scream. 'Jadom,
Jadom!' She was evidently calling to her Adam,
but the other women took up the word and cried,
'Jadą.'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A shrill voice among them added: 'The
French are coming!' and in the twinkling of an
eye a panic seized not only the women, but also
the future heroes of Sedan. The crowd swerved.
At that moment the train entered the station.
Caps and uniforms were seen to be at all the
windows. Soldiers seemed to swarm like ants.
Dark, oblong bodies of cannon showed grimly on
some of the trucks, on others there was a forest
of bayonets. The soldiers had, apparently, been
ordered to sing, for the whole train shook with
their strong masculine voices. Strength and
power seemed in some way to issue from that
train, the end of which was not even in sight.</p>

<p>The Reservists on the platform began to fall in,
but anyone who could lingered in taking leave.
Bartek swung his arms as if they were the sails
of a windmill, and stared.</p>

<p>'Well, Magda, good-bye!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, my poor fellow!'</p>

<p>'You will never see me again!'</p>

<p>'I shall never see you again!'</p>

<p>'There's no help for it!'</p>

<p>'May the Mother of God protect and shelter
you!'</p>

<p>'Good-bye. Take care of the cottage.'</p>

<p>The woman embraced him in tears.</p>

<p>'May God guide you!'</p>

<p>The last moment had come. The whistle and
the women's crying and sobbing drowned everything
else. 'Good-bye! Good-bye!' But the
soldiers were already separated from the motley
crowd, and formed a dark, solid mass, moving
forward in square columns with the certainty and
regularity of clockwork. The order was given:
'Take your seats!' Columns and squares broke
asunder from the centre, marched with heavy
strides towards the carriages, and jumped into
them. The engine, now breathing like a dragon
and exhaling streams of vapour, sent forth
wreaths of grey smoke. The women cried and
sobbed still louder; some of them hid their eyes
with their handkerchiefs, others waved their hands
towards the carriages; sobbing voices repeated
the name of husband and son.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Bartek!' Magda cried from amongst
them. 'Take care of yourself!&mdash;May the Mother
of God&mdash;Good-bye! Oh, God!&mdash;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>'And take care of the cottage,' answered
Bartek.</p>

<p>The line of trucks suddenly trembled, the carriages
knocked against one another,&mdash;and went
forward.</p>

<p>'And remember you have a wife and child,'
Magda cried, running after the train. 'Good-bye,
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost! Good-bye&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>On went the train, faster and faster, bearing
away the warriors of Pognębin, of both Krzywdas,
of Niedola, and Mizerów.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>Magda, with the crowd of women, returned
crying to Pognębin in one direction; in the
other the train, bristling with bayonets, rushed
into the grey distance, and Bartek with it. There
seemed to be no end to the long cloud of smoke;
Pognębin was also scarcely visible. Only the
lime-tree showed faintly, and the church tower,
glistening as the rays of the sun played upon it.
Soon the lime-tree also disappeared, and the gilt
cross resembled a shining speck. As long as that
speck continued to shine Bartek kept his eyes
fixed upon it, but when that vanished too there
were no bounds to the poor fellow's grief. A
sense of great weakness came over him and he
felt lost. So he began to look at the Sergeant,
for, after the Almighty, he already felt there was
no one greater than he. The Sergeant clearly
knew what would become of Bartek now; he
himself knew nothing, understood nothing. The
Sergeant sat on the bench, and, supporting his
rifle between his knees, he lighted his pipe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
smoke rose in clouds, hiding his grave, discontented
face from time to time. Not Bartek's eyes
alone watched his face; all the eyes from every
corner of the carriage were watching it. At Pognębin
or Krzywda every Bartek or Wojtek was his
own master, each had to think about himself, and
for himself, but now the Sergeant would do this
for him. He would command them to look to the
right, and they would look to the right; he would
command them to look to the left, and they would
look to the left. The question, 'Well, and what
is to become of us?' stood in each man's eyes,
but he knew as much as all of them put together,
and also what was expected of them. If only
one were able by glances to draw some command
or explanation from him! But the men were
afraid to ask direct, as war was now drawing
near with all the chances of being court-martialled.
What was permitted and was not
permitted, and by whom, was unknown. They,
at least, did not know, and the sound of such
a word as 'Kriegsgericht,' though they did not
understand it, frightened them very much.</p>

<p>They felt that this Sergeant had still more
power over them now than at the manœuvres in
Posen; he it was who knew everything, and
without him nothing would be done. He seemed
meanwhile to be finding his rifle growing heavy,
for he pushed it towards Bartek to hold for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Bartek reached out hastily for it, held his breath,
stared, and looked at the Sergeant as he would at
a rainbow, yet derived little comfort from that.
Ah, there must surely be bad news, for even the
Sergeant looked worried. At the stations one
heard singing and shouting; the Sergeant gave
orders, bustled about and swore, as if to show his
importance. But let the train once move on, and
everyone, including himself, was silent. Owing
to him the world now seemed to wear two aspects,
the one clear and intelligible&mdash;that represented by
home and family&mdash;the other dark, yes, absolutely
dark&mdash;that of France and war. He effectually
revived the spirits of the Pognębin soldiers, not
so much by his personality, as that each man
carried him at the back of his mind. And since
each soldier carried his knapsack on his shoulder,
with his cloak and other warlike accoutrements,
the whole load was extremely heavy.</p>

<p>All the while the train was shaking, roaring,
and rushing along into space. Now a station
where they added fresh carriages and engines;
now another where helmets, cannon, horses,
bayonets, and companies of Lancers were to be
seen. The fine evening drew in slowly. The sun
sank in a deep crimson, and a number of light
flying clouds spread from the edge of the darkening
sky across to the west. The train, stopping
frequently at the stations to pick up passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and carriages, shook and rushed forward into
that crimson brightness, as into a sea of blood.
From the open carriage, in which Bartek and the
Pognębin troops were seated, one could see villages,
hamlets and little towns, church steeples,
storks&mdash;looking like hooks, as they stood on one
leg on their nests,&mdash;isolated cottages, and cherry
orchards. Everything was passed rapidly, and
everything looked crimson. Meanwhile the soldiers,
growing bolder, began to whisper to one
another, because the Sergeant, having laid his
kit bag under his head, had fallen asleep, with his
clay pipe between his teeth. Wojtek Gwizdała, a
peasant from Pognębin, sitting beside Bartek,
jogged his elbow: 'Bartek, listen!'</p>

<p>Bartek turned a face with pensive, wide open
eyes towards him.</p>

<p>'Why do you look like a calf going to be
slaughtered?' Gwizdała whispered. 'True, you,
poor beggar, are going to be slaughtered, that's
certain!'</p>

<p>'Oh, my word!' groaned Bartek.</p>

<p>'Are you afraid?' Gwizdała asked.</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't I be afraid?'</p>

<p>The crimson in the sky was growing deeper
still, so Gwizdała pointed towards it and went on
whispering:</p>

<p>'Do you see that brightness? Do you know,
Blockhead, what that is? That's blood. Here's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Poland,&mdash;our frontier, say,&mdash;do you understand?
But there in the distance, where it's so bright,
that's France itself.'</p>

<p>'And shall we be there soon?'</p>

<p>'Why are you in such a hurry? They say that
it's a terribly long way. But never fear, the
French will come out to meet us.'</p>

<p>Bartek's Pognębin brain began to work laboriously.
After some moments he asked: 'Wojtek.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'What sort of people are these Frenchmen?'</p>

<p>Here Wojtek's wisdom suddenly became aware
of a pitfall into which it might be easier to tumble
headforemost than to come out again. He knew
that the French were the French. He had heard
something about them from old people, who had
related that they were always fighting with everyone;
he knew at least that they were very strange
people. But how could he explain this to Bartek
to make him understand how strange they were?
First of all, therefore, he repeated the question,
'What sort of people?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes.'</p>

<p>Now there were three nations known to Wojtek:
living in the centre were the Poles; on the
one side were the Russians, on the other the
Germans. But there were various kinds of Germans.
Preferring, therefore, to be clear rather
than accurate, he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>'What sort of people are the French? How
can I tell you; they must be like the Germans,
only worse.'</p>

<p>At which Bartek exclaimed: 'Oh, the low
vermin!'</p>

<p>Up to that time he had had one feeling only
with regard to the French, and that was a feeling
of unspeakable fear. Henceforth this Prussian
Reservist cherished the hatred of a true patriot
towards them. But not feeling quite clear about
it all, he asked again: 'Then Germans will be
fighting Germans?'</p>

<p>Here Wojtek, like a second Socrates, chose to
adopt a simile, and answered:</p>

<p>'But doesn't your dog, Łysek, fight with my
Burek?'</p>

<p>Bartek opened his mouth and looked at his
instructor for a moment: 'Ah! true.'</p>

<p>'And the Austrians are Germans,' explained
Wojtek, 'and haven't they fought against us?
Old Swierzcz said that when he was in that war
Steinmetz used to shout: "On, boys, at the
Germans!" Only that's not so easy with the
French.'</p>

<p>'Good God!'</p>

<p>'The French have never been beaten in any
war. When they attack you, don't be afraid,
don't disgrace yourself. Each man is worth two
or three of us, and they wear beards like Jews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
There are some as dark as the devil. Now that
you know what they are like, commend yourself
to God!'</p>

<p>'Well, but then why do we run after them?'
Bartek asked in desperation.</p>

<p>This philosophical remark was possibly not as
stupid as it appeared to Wojtek, who, evidently
influenced by official opinion, quickly had his
answer ready.</p>

<p>'I would rather not have gone myself, but if
we don't run after them, they will run after us.
There's no help for it. You have read what the
papers say. It's against us peasants that they
bear the chief grudge. People say that they have
their eyes on Poland, because they want to
smuggle vodka out of the country, and the Government
won't allow it, and that's why there's
war. Now do you understand?'</p>

<p>'I cannot understand,' Bartek said resignedly.</p>

<p>'They are also as greedy for our women as a
dog for a bone,' Wojtek continued.</p>

<p>'But surely they would respect Magda, for
example?'</p>

<p>'They don't even respect age!'</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Bartek in a voice implying, 'If that
is so then I will fight!'</p>

<p>In fact this seemed to him really too much.
Let them continue to smuggle vodka out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Poland,&mdash;but let them dare to touch Magda! Our
friend Bartek now began to regard the whole war
from the standpoint of his own interests, and took
courage in the thought of how many soldiers and
cannon were going out in defence of Magda, who
was in danger of being outraged by the French.
He arrived at the conviction that there was
nothing for it but to go out against them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the brightness had faded from the
sky, and it had grown dark. The carriages began
to rock violently on the uneven rails, and the
helmets and bayonets shook from right to left to
the rhythm of the rocking. Hour after hour
passed by. Millions of sparks flew from the
engine and crossed one another in the darkness,
serpentining in long golden lines. For a while
Bartek could not sleep. Like those sparks in the
wind, thoughts leapt into his mind about Magda,
about Pognębin, the French and the Germans.
He felt that though he would have liked to have
lain down on the bench on which he was sitting,
he could not do so. He fell asleep, it is true, but
it was a heavy, unrefreshing sleep, and he was at
once pursued by dreams. He saw his dog, Łysek,
fighting with Wojtek's Burek, till all their hair
was torn off. He was running for a stick to stop
them, when suddenly he saw something else:
sitting with his arm round Magda was a dark
Frenchman, as dark as the earth; but Magda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was smiling contentedly. Some Frenchmen jeered
at Bartek, and pointed their fingers at him. In
reality it was the engine screaming, but it seemed
to him that the French were calling, 'Magda!
Magda! Magda!' 'Hold your tongue, thieves,'
Bartek shouted, 'leave my wife alone!' but they
continued calling 'Magda! Magda! Magda!'
Łysek and Burek started barking, and all Pognębin
cried out, 'Don't let your wife go!' Was he
bound, or what was the matter? No, he rushed
forward, tore at the cord and broke it, seized the
Frenchman by the head,&mdash;and suddenly&mdash;!</p>

<p>Suddenly he was seized with severe pain, as
from a heavy blow. Bartek awoke and dragged
his feet to the ground. The whole carriage
awoke, and everyone asked, 'What has happened?'
In his sleep the unfortunate Bartek had
seized the Sergeant by the head. He stood up
immediately, as straight as a fiddle-string, two
fingers at his forehead; but the Sergeant waved
his hand, and shouted like mad:</p>

<p>'Ach, Sie! beast of a Pole! I'll knock all the
teeth out of your head,&mdash;blockhead!'</p>

<p>The Sergeant shouted until he was hoarse with
rage, and Bartek stood saluting all the while.
Some of the soldiers bit their lips in order not to
laugh, but they were half afraid, too. A parting
shot burst forth from the Sergeant's lips:</p>

<p>'You Polish Ox! Ox from Podolia!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Ultimately everything became quiet again. Bartek
sat back in his old place. He was conscious
of nothing but that his cheek was swollen, and,
as if playing him a trick, the engine kept repeating:</p>

<p>'Magda! Magda! Magda!'</p>

<p>He felt a heavy weight of sorrow upon him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>It was morning!</p>

<p>The fitful, pale light fell on faces sleepy and
worn with a long restless night. The soldiers
were sleeping in discomfort on the seats, some
with their heads thrown forward, others with
their noses in the air. The dawn was rising
and flooding all the world with crimson light.
The air was fresh and keen. The soldiers awoke.
The morning rays were drawing away shadows
and mist into some region unknown. Alas! and
where was now Pognębin, where Great and Little
Kzrywda, where Mizerów? Everything was
strange and different. The summits of the hills
were overgrown with trees; in the valleys were
houses hidden under red roofs, with dark crucifixes
on the white walls,&mdash;beautiful houses like
mansions, covered with vines. Here, churches
with spires, there, factory chimneys with wreaths
of purple smoke. There were only straight lines,
level banks, and fields of corn. The inhabitants
swarmed like ants. They passed villages and
towns, and the train went through a number of
unimportant stations without stopping. Something
must have happened, for there were crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to be seen everywhere. When the sun slowly
began to appear from behind the hills, one or
two of the soldiers commenced saying a prayer
aloud. Others followed their example, and the
first rays of splendour fell on the men's earnest,
devout faces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train had stopped at a larger
station. A crowd of people immediately surrounded
it: news had come from the seat of war.
Victory! Victory! Telegrams had been arriving
for several hours. Everyone had anticipated defeat,
so when roused by the unexpected news,
their joy knew no bounds. People rushed half-clad
from their houses and their beds, and ran to
the post-office. Flags were waving from the
roofs, and handkerchiefs from everyone's hands.
Beer, tobacco and cigars were carried to the
carriages. The enthusiasm was unspeakable;
everyone's face was beaming. 'Die Wacht am
Rhein' filled the air continuously like a tempest.
Not a few were weeping, others embraced one
another. The enthusiasm animating the crowd
imparted itself to the gallant soldiers, their courage
rose, and they too began to sing. The
carriages trembled with their strong voices, and
the crowd listened in wonder to their unintelligible
songs. The men from Pognębin sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'Bartoszu! Bartoszu! never lose hope!'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'The Poles, the Poles!' repeated the crowd by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
way of explanation, and, gathering round the
carriages, admired their soldierly bearing, and
added to their joy by relating anecdotes of the
remarkable courage of these Polish Regiments.</p>

<p>Bartek had unshaven cheeks, which, in addition
to his yellow moustache, goggle-eyes, and large
bony face, made him look terrifying. They gazed
at him as at some wild beast. These, then, were
the men who were to defend Germany! Such were
they who had just disposed of the French! Bartek
smiled with satisfaction, for he too was pleased
that they had beaten the French. Now they
would not go to Pognębin, they would not make
off with Magda, nor capture his land. So he
smiled, but as his cheek hurt him badly, he made
a grimace at the same time, and did certainly
look terrifying. Then, displaying the appetite of
a Homeric warrior, he caused pea-sausages and
pints of beer to disappear into his mouth as into
a vacuum. People in the crowd gave him cigars
and pence, and they all drank to one another.</p>

<p>'There's some good in this German nation,' he
said to Wojtek, adding after a moment, 'and you
know they have beaten the French!'</p>

<p>But Wojtek, the sceptic, cast a shadow on his
joy. Wojtek had forebodings, like Cassandra:</p>

<p>'The French always allow themselves to be
beaten at first, in order to take you in, and then
they set to until they have cut you to pieces!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Wojtek did not know that the greater part of
Europe shared his opinion, in general, and in
particular now.</p>

<p>They travelled on. All the houses were covered
with flags. They stopped a long while at several
of the stations, because there was a block of trains
everywhere. Troops were hastening from all
sides of Germany to reinforce their brothers in
arms. The trains were swathed in green wreaths,
and the Lancers had decorated their lances with
the bunches of flowers given them on the way.
The majority of these Lancers also were Poles.
More than one conversation and greeting was
heard passing from carriage to carriage:</p>

<p>'How are you, old fellow, and where is God
Almighty leading you?'</p>

<p>Meanwhile to the accompaniment of the train
rumbling along the rails, the well-known song
rang out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'Flirt with us, soldiers! dears!'</span><br />
<span class="i2">Cried the girls of Sandomierz.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And soon Bartek and his comrades caught up
the refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">Gaily forth the answer burst:</span><br />
<span class="i2">'Bless you, dears! but dinner first!'</span><br />
</div>

<p>As many as had gone out from Pognębin in
sorrow were now filled with enthusiasm and spirit.
A train which had arrived from France with the
first batch of wounded, damped this feeling of
cheerfulness, however. It stopped at Deutz, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
waited a long time to allow the trains hurrying
to the seat of war to go by. The men were
marched across the bridge <i>en route</i> for Cologne.
Bartek ran forward with several others to look at
the sick and wounded. Some lay in closed, others
in open carriages, and these could be seen well.
At the first glance our hero's heart was again in
his mouth.</p>

<p>'Come here, Wojtek,' he cried in terror. 'See
how many of our countrymen the Frenchmen have
done for!'</p>

<p>It was indeed a sight! Pale, exhausted faces,
some darkened by gunpowder or by pain, or
stained with blood. To the sounds of universal
rejoicing these men only responded by groans.
Some were cursing the war, the French and the
Germans. Parched lips called every moment for
water, eyes rolled in delirium. Here and there,
amongst the wounded, were the rigid faces of the
dead, in some cases peaceful, with blue lines round
their eyes, in others contorted through the death
struggle, with terrifying eyes and grinning teeth.
Bartek saw the bloody fruits of war for the first
time, and once more confusion reigned in his
mind. He seemed quite stupefied, as, standing
in the crowd, with his mouth open, he was
elbowed from every side, and pomelled on the
neck by the police. He sought Wojtek's eyes,
nudged him, and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>'Wojtek, may Heaven preserve us! It's horrible!'</p>

<p>'It will be just the same with you.'</p>

<p>'Jesu! Mary! That human beings should
murder one another like this! When a fellow kills
another the police take him off to the magistrate
and prison!'</p>

<p>'Well, but now whoever kills most human
beings is to be praised. What were you thinking
of, Blockhead: did you think you would use gunpowder
as in the manœuvres, and would shoot at
targets instead of people?'</p>

<p>Here the difference between theory and practice
certainly stood out clearly. Notwithstanding that
our friend Bartek was a soldier, had attended
manœuvres and drill, had practised rifle shooting,
had known that the object of war was to kill
people, now, when he saw blood flowing, and all
the misery of war, it made him feel so sick and
miserable he could hardly keep himself upright.
He was impressed anew with respect for the
French; this diminished, however, when they
arrived at Cologne from Deutz. At the Central
Station they saw prisoners for the first time. Surrounding
them was a number of soldiers and
people, who gazed at them with interest, but without
hostility. Bartek elbowed his way through
the crowd, and, looking into the carriage, was
amazed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>A troop of French infantry in ragged cloaks,
small, dirty, and emaciated, were packed into the
carriages like a cask of herrings. Many of them
stretched out their hands for the trifling gifts
presented to them by the crowd, if the sentinels
did not prevent them. Judging from what he had
heard from Wojtek, Bartek had had a wholly
different impression of the French, and this took
his breath away. He looked to see if Wojtek
were anywhere about, and found him standing
close by.</p>

<p>'What did you say?' asked Bartek. 'By all
the Saints! I shouldn't be more surprised if I had
lost my head!'</p>

<p>'They must have been starved somehow,'
answered Wojtek, equally disillusioned.</p>

<p>'What are they jabbering?'</p>

<p>'It's certainly not Polish.'</p>

<p>Reassured by this impression, Bartek walked on
past the carriages. 'Miserable wretches!' he
said, when he had finished his review of the Regulars.</p>

<p>But the last carriages contained Zouaves, and
these gave Bartek food for further reflection.
From the fact that they sat huddled together in
the carriages, it was impossible to discover
whether each man were equal to two or three
ordinary men; but, through the window, he saw
the long, martial beards, and grave faces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
veteran soldiers with dark complexions and alarmingly
shining eyes. Again Bartek's heart leapt to
his mouth.</p>

<p>'These are the worst of all,' he whispered low,
as if afraid they might hear him.</p>

<p>'You have not yet seen those who have not let
themselves be taken prisoner,' replied Wojtek.</p>

<p>'Heaven preserve us!'</p>

<p>'Now do you understand?'</p>

<p>Having finished looking at the Zouaves, they
walked on. At the last carriage Bartek suddenly
started back as if he had touched fire.</p>

<p>'Oh, Wojtek, Lord help us!'</p>

<p>There was the dark&mdash;nearly black&mdash;face of a
Turco at the open window, rolling his eyes so that
the whites showed. He must have been wounded,
for his face was contorted with pain.</p>

<p>'But what's the matter?' asked Wojtek.</p>

<p>'That must be the Evil One, it's not a soldier.
Lord have mercy on my sins!'</p>

<p>'Look at his teeth!'</p>

<p>'May he go to perdition! I shan't look at him
any longer.'</p>

<p>Bartek was silent, then asked after a moment:</p>

<p>'Wojtek?'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'Mightn't it be a good thing to cross oneself
before anyone like that?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>'The heathen don't understand anything about
the holy truth.'</p>

<p>The signal was given for taking their seats.
In a few moments the train was moving. When
it grew dusk Bartek continually saw before him
the Turco's dark face with the terrible white of his
eyes. From the feeling which at the moment
animated this Pognębin soldier, it would not have
been possible to foretell his future deeds.</p>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>The particular share he took at first in the
pitched battle of Gravelotte, merely convinced
Bartek of this fact,&mdash;that in war there is
plenty to look at, but nothing to do. For at the
commencement he and his regiment were told to
order arms and wait at the bottom of a hill covered
by a vineyard. The guns were booming in the distance,
squadrons of cavalry charged past near at
hand with a clatter which shook the earth; then
the flags passed, then Cuirassiers with drawn
swords. The shells on the hill flew hissing across
the blue sky in the form of small white clouds,
then smoke filled the air and hid the horizon.
The battle seemed like a storm which passes
through a district without lasting long anywhere.</p>

<p>After the first hours, unusual activity was displayed
round Bartek's regiment. Other regiments
began to be massed round his, and in the spaces
between them, the guns, drawn by plunging
horses, rushed along, and, hastily unlimbered,
were pointed towards the hill. The whole valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
became full of troops. Commands were now
thundered from all sides, the Aides-de-Camps
rushed about wildly, and the private soldiers said
to one another:</p>

<p>'Ah! it will be our turn now! It's coming!' or
enquired uneasily of one another,</p>

<p>'Isn't it yet time to start?'</p>

<p>'Surely it must be!'</p>

<p>The question of life and death was now beginning
to hang in the balance. Something in the
smoke, which hid the horizon, burst close at hand
with a terrible explosion. The deep roar of the
cannon and the crack of the rifle firing was heard
ever nearer; it was like an indistinct sound coming
from a distance,&mdash;then the mitrailleuse became
audible. Suddenly the guns, placed in position,
boomed forth until the earth and air trembled
together. The shells whistled frightfully through
Bartek's company. Watching they saw something
bright red, a little cloud, as it might be, and
in that cloud something whistled, rushed, rattled,
roared, and shrieked. The men shouted: 'A
shell! A shell,' and at the same moment this
vulture of war sped forward like a gale, came
near, fell, and burst! A terrible roar met the ear,
a crash as if the world had collapsed, followed by
a rushing sound, as before a puff of wind! Confusion
reigned in the lines standing in the neighbourhood
of the guns, then came the cry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
command 'Stand ready!' Bartek stood in the
front rank, his rifle at his shoulder, his head
turned towards the hill, his mouth set,&mdash;so his
teeth were not chattering. He was forbidden to
tremble, he was forbidden to shoot. He had
only to stand still and wait! But now another
shell burst,&mdash;three, four, ten. The wind lifted the
smoke from the hill: the French had already
driven the Prussian battery from it, had placed
theirs in position, and now opened fire on to the
valley. Every moment from under cover of the
vineyard they sent forth long white columns of
smoke. Protected by the guns, the enemy's
infantry continued to advance, in order to open
fire. They were already half way down the hill
and could now be seen plainly, for the wind was
driving the smoke away. Would the vineyard
prove an obstacle to them? No, the dark caps of
the infantry were advancing. Suddenly they disappeared
under the tall arches of the vines, and
there was nothing to be seen but tricolour flags
waving here and there. The rifle fire began
fiercely but intermittently, continually starting in
fresh and unexpected places. Shells burst above
it, and crossed one another in the air. Now
and then cries rang out from the hill, which were
answered from below by a German 'Hurrah!'
The guns from the valley sent forth an uninterrupted
fire; the regiment stood unflinching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The line of fire began to embrace it more
closely, however. The bullets hummed in the
distance like gnats and flies, or passed near with
a terrible whizz. More and more of them came:&mdash;hundreds,
thousands, whistling round their heads,
their noses, their eyes, their shoulders; it was
astonishing there should be a man left standing.
Suddenly Bartek heard a groan close by: 'Jesu!'
then 'Stand ready!' then again 'Jesu!' 'Stand
ready!' Soon the groans went on without intermission,
the words of command came faster and
faster, the lines drew in closer, the whizzing grew
more frequent, more uninterrupted, more terrible.
The dead covered the ground. It was like the
Judgment Day.</p>

<p>'Are you afraid?' Wojtek asked.</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't I be afraid?' our hero answered,
his teeth chattering.</p>

<p>Nevertheless both Bartek and Wojtek still kept
their feet, and it did not even enter their heads
to run away. They had been commanded to
stand still and receive the enemy's fire. Bartek
had not spoken the truth; he was not as much
afraid as thousands of others would have been in
his place. Discipline held the mastery over his
imagination, and his imagination had never painted
such a horrible situation as this. Nevertheless
Bartek felt that he would be killed, and he confided
this thought to Wojtek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>'There won't be room in Heaven for the numbers
they kill,' Wojtek answered in an excited
voice.</p>

<p>These words comforted Bartek perceptibly. He
began to hope that his place in Heaven had already
been taken. Re-assured with regard to this, he
stood more patiently, conscious only of the intense
heat, and with the perspiration running down his
face. Meantime the firing became so heavy that
the ranks were thinning visibly. There was no
one to carry away the killed and wounded; the
death rattle of the dying mingled with the whizz
of shells and the din of shooting. One could see
by the movement of the tricolour flags that the
infantry hidden by the vines was coming closer
and closer. The volleys of mitrailleuse decimated
the ranks; the men were beginning to grow
desperate.</p>

<p>But underlying this despair were impatience
and rage. Had they been commanded to go forward,
they would have gone like a whirlwind. It
was impossible to merely stand still in one spot.
A soldier suddenly threw down his helmet with his
whole force, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Curse it! One death is as good as another!'</p>

<p>Bartek again experienced such a feeling of relief
from these words that he almost entirely ceased
to be afraid. For if one death was as good as
another, what did anything matter? This rustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
philosophy was calculated to arouse courage more
rapidly than any other. Bartek knew that one
death was as good as another, but it pleased him
to hear it, especially as the battle was now turning
into a defeat. For here was a regiment which
had never fired a single shot, and was already
half annihilated. Crowds of soldiers from other
regiments which had been scattered, ran in
amongst and round theirs in disorder; only
these peasants from Pognębin, Great and Little
Krzywda, and Mizerów still remained firm, upholding
Prussian discipline. But even amongst them
a certain degree of hesitation now began to be
felt. Another moment and they would have burst
the restraint of discipline. The ground under
their feet was already soft and slippery with blood,
the stench of which mingled with the smell of
gunpowder. In several places the lines could not
join up closely, because the dead bodies made gaps
in them. At the feet of those men yet standing,
the other half lay bleeding, groaning, struggling,
dying, or in the silence of death. There was no
air to breathe in. They began to grumble:</p>

<p>'They have brought us out to be slaughtered!'</p>

<p>'No one will come out of this!'</p>

<p>'Silence, Polish dogs!' sounded the officer's
voice.</p>

<p>'I should just like you to be standing in my
shoes!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>'Where is that fellow?'</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice began to repeat:</p>

<p>'Beneath Thy Shadow....'</p>

<p>Bartek instantly took it up:</p>

<p>'We flee, O holy Son of God!'</p>

<p>And soon on that field of carnage a chorus of
Polish voices was calling to the Defender of their
nation:</p>

<p>'Of Thy favour regard our prayers.'</p>

<p>while from beneath their feet there came the
accompaniment of groans: 'Mary! Mary!' She
had evidently heard them, for at that moment the
Aide-de-Camps came galloping up, and the command
rang forth: 'Arms to the attack! Hurrah!
Forward!' The crest of bayonets was suddenly
lowered, the column stretched out into a long line
and sprang towards the hill to seek with their
bayonets the enemy they could not discover with
their eyes. The men were, however, still two
hundred yards from the foot of the hill, and they
had to traverse that distance under a murderous
fire. Would they not perish like the rest? Would
they not be obliged to retreat? Perish they might,
but retreat they could not, for the Prussian commander
knows what tune will bring Polish soldiers
to the attack. Amid the roar of cannon, amid the
rifle fire and the smoke, the confusion and groaning,
loudest of all sounded the drums and trumpets,
playing the hymn at which every single drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of blood leapt in their veins. 'Hurrah!' answered
the Macki<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> 'as long as we live!' Frenzy seized
them. The fire met them full in the face. They
went like a whirlwind over the prostrate bodies of
men and horses, over the wrecks of cannon. They
fell, but they went with a shout and a song. They
had already reached the vineyard and disappeared
into its enclosure. Only the song was heard, and
at times a bayonet glittered. On the hill the firing
became increasingly fierce. In the valley the
trumpets kept on sounding. The French volleys
continued faster and faster,&mdash;still faster,&mdash;and
suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly they were silent.</p>

<p>Down in the valley that old wardog, Steinmetz,
lighted his clay pipe, and said in a tone of satisfaction:</p>

<p>'You have only to play to them! The daredevils
will do it!'</p>

<p>And actually in a few moments one of the
proudly waving tricolours was suddenly raised
aloft, then drooped, and disappeared.</p>

<p>'They are not joking,' said Steinmetz.</p>

<p>Again the trumpets played the hymn, and a
second Polish regiment went to the help of the
first. In the enclosure a pitched battle with
bayonets was taking place.</p>

<p>And now, oh Muse, sing of our hero, Bartek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that posterity may know of his deeds! The fear,
impatience, and despair of his heart had mingled
into the single feeling of rage, and when he heard
that music each vein stood out in him like cast
iron. His hair stood on end, his eyes shot fire.
He forgot everything that had made up his world;
he no longer cared whether one death was as good
as another. Grasping his rifle firmly in his hands,
he leapt forward with the others. Reaching the
hill he fell down for the tenth time, struck his
nose, and, bespattered with mud and the blood
flowing from his nose, ran on madly and breathlessly,
catching at the air with open mouth. He
stared round, wishing to find some of the French
in the enclosure as quickly as possible, and caught
sight of three standing together near the flags.
They were Turcos. Would Bartek retreat? No,
indeed; he could have seized the horns of Lucifer
himself now! He ran towards them at once, and
they fell on him with a shout; two bayonets, like
two deadly stings, had actually touched his chest
already, but Bartek lowered his bayonet. A
dreadful cry followed,&mdash;a groan, and two dark
bodies lay writhing convulsively on the ground.</p>

<p>At that moment the third, who carried the flag,
ran up to help his two comrades. Like a Fury,
Bartek leapt on him with his whole strength. The
firing flashed and roared in the distance, while
Bartek's hoarse roar rang out through the smoke:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>'Go to Hell!'</p>

<p>And again the rifle in his hand described a
fearful semi-circle, again groans responded to his
thrusts. The Turcos retreated in terror at the
sight of this furious giant, but either Bartek misunderstood,
or they shouted out something in
Arabic, for it seemed to him that their thick lips
distinctly uttered the cry: 'Magda! Magda!'</p>

<p>'Magda will give it you!' howled Bartek, and
with one leap he was in the enemy's midst.</p>

<p>Happily at that moment some of his comrades
ran up to his assistance. A hand to hand fight now
took place in the enclosure of the vineyard. There
was the crack of rifles at close quarters, and
the hot breath of the combatants sounded through
their nostrils. Bartek raged like a storm.
Blinded by smoke, streaming with blood, more
like a wild beast than a man, and regardless of
everything, he mowed down men at each blow,
broke rifles, cracked heads. His hands moved
with the terrible swiftness of a machine sowing
destruction. He attacked the Ensign, and seized
him by the throat with an iron grip. The Ensign's
eyes turned upwards, his face swelled, his throat
rattled, and his hands let the pole fall.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' cried Bartek, and, lifting the flag,
he waved it in the air.</p>

<p>This was the flag raised aloft and drooping,
which Steinmetz had seen from below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>But he could only see it for half a second, for in
the next&mdash;Bartek had trampled it to shreds. Meanwhile
his comrades were already rushing on ahead.</p>

<p>Bartek remained alone for a moment. He tore
off the flag, hid it in his breast pocket, and, having
seized the pole in both hands, rushed after his
comrades.</p>

<p>A crowd of Turcos, shouting in a barbarous
tongue, now fled towards the gun placed on the
summit of the hill, the Macki after them, shouting,
pursuing, striking with butt-end and bayonet.</p>

<p>The Zouaves, who were stationed by the guns,
received the first men with rifle fire.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' shouted Bartek.</p>

<p>The men ran up to the guns, and a fresh struggle
took place round these. At that moment the
second Polish regiment came to the aid of the first.
The flag pole in Bartek's powerful hands was now
changed into a kind of infernal flail. Each stroke
dealt by it opened a free passage through the
close lines of the French. The Zouaves and
Turcos began to be seized with panic, and they
fled from the place where Bartek was fighting.
Within a few moments Bartek was sitting astride
the gun, as he might his Pognębin mare.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the soldiers had time to see
him on this, when he was already on the second,
after killing another Ensign who was standing by
it with the flag.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>'Hurrah, Bartek!' repeatedly exclaimed the
soldiers.</p>

<p>The victory was complete. All the ammunition
was captured. The infantry fled, and after being
surrounded by Prussian reinforcements on the
other side of the hill, laid down their arms.</p>

<p>Bartek captured yet a third flag during the
pursuit.</p>

<p>It was worth seeing him, when exhausted,
covered with blood, and blowing like a blacksmith's
bellows, he now descended the hill
together with the rest, bearing the three flags
on his shoulder. The French? Why, what had
not he alone done to them! By his side went
Wojtek, scratched and scarred, so he turned to
him and said:</p>

<p>'What did you say? Why, they are miserable
wretches; there isn't a scrap of strength in their
bones! They have just scratched you and me
like kittens, and that's all. But how I have bled
them you can see by the ground!'</p>

<p>'Who would have known that you could be so
brave!' replied Wojtek, who had watched Bartek's
deeds, and began to look at him in quite a
different light.</p>

<p>But who has not heard of these deeds? History,
all the regiment and the greater number of the
officers. Everybody now looked with astonishment
at this country giant with the flaxen moustache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and goggle eyes. The Major himself said
to him, 'Ah, you confounded Pole!' and pulled
his ear, making Bartek grin to his back teeth
with pleasure. When the regiment stood once
more at the foot of the hill, the Major pointed
him out to the Colonel, and the Colonel to Steinmetz
himself.</p>

<p>The latter noticed the flags, and ordered that
they should be taken charge of; then he began
to look at Bartek. Our friend Bartek again stood
as straight as a fiddle string, presenting arms,
and the old General looked at him and shook his
head with pleasure. Finally he began to say
something to the Colonel; the words 'non-commissioned
officer' were plainly audible.</p>

<p>'Too stupid, Your Excellency!' answered the
Major.</p>

<p>'Let us try,' said His Excellency, and turning
his horse, he approached Bartek.</p>

<p>Bartek himself scarcely knew what was happening
to him: it was a thing unknown in the
Prussian Army for the General to talk to a
Private! His Excellency was the more easily
able to do this, because he knew Polish. Moreover
this Private had captured three flags and two
guns.</p>

<p>'Where do you come from?' enquired the
General.</p>

<p>'From Pognębin,' answered Bartek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>'Good. Your name?'</p>

<p>'Bartek Słowik.'</p>

<p>'Mensch,' explained the Major.</p>

<p>'Mens!' Bartek tried to repeat.</p>

<p>'Do you know why you are fighting the
French?'</p>

<p>'I know, Your Excellency.'</p>

<p>'Tell me.'</p>

<p>Bartek began to stammer, 'Because, because&mdash;'
Then on a sudden Wojtek's words fortunately
came into his mind, and he burst out with them
quickly, so as not to get confused: 'Because
they are Germans too, only worse villains!'</p>

<p>His Excellency's face began to twitch as if he
felt inclined to burst out laughing. After a
moment, however, His Excellency turned to the
Major, and said:</p>

<p>'You are right, Sir.'</p>

<p>Our friend Bartek, satisfied with himself, remained
standing as straight as a fiddle string.</p>

<p>'Who won the battle to-day?' the General
asked again.</p>

<p>'I, Your Excellency,' Bartek answered without
hesitation.</p>

<p>His Excellency's face again began to twitch.</p>

<p>'Right, very right, it was you! And here you
have your reward.'</p>

<p>Here the old soldier unpinned the iron cross
from his own breast, stooped and pinned it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to Bartek. The General's good humour was
reflected in a perfectly natural way on the faces
of the Colonel, the Majors, the Captains, down
to the non-commissioned officers. After the
General's departure the Colonel for his own part
presented Bartek with ten thalers, the Major with
five, and so on. Everyone repeated to him
smilingly that he had won the battle, with the
result that Bartek was in the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing: the only person who
was not really satisfied with our hero was Wojtek.</p>

<p>In the evening, when they were both sitting
round the fire, and when Bartek's distinguished
face was bulging as much with pea sausage as
the sausage itself, Wojtek ejaculated in a tone of
resignation:</p>

<p>'Oh Bartek, what a blockhead you are, because&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But why?' said Bartek, between his bites of
sausage.</p>

<p>'Why, man, didn't you tell the General that
the French are Germans?'</p>

<p>'You said so yourself.'</p>

<p>'And what of that?&mdash;'</p>

<p>Wojtek began to stammer a little&mdash;'Well,
though they may be Germans, you needn't have
told him so, because it's always unpleasant&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But I said it about the French, not about
them....'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah, because when....'</p>

<p>Wojtek stopped short, though evidently wishing
to say something further; he wished to explain
to Bartek that it is not suitable when among
Germans to speak evil of them, but somehow his
tongue became entangled.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>A little while later the Royal Prussian Mail
brought the following letter to Pognębin:</p>

<blockquote><p>May Jesus Christ and His Holy Mother be praised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Magda!</span> What news of you? It is all right for
you to be able to rest quietly in bed at home, but I am
fighting horribly hard here. We have been surrounding the
great fort of Metz, and there was a battle, and I did for
so many of the French that all the Infantry and Artillery
were astonished. And the General himself was astonished,
and said that I had won the battle, and gave me a cross.
And the officers and non-commissioned officers respect me
very much now, and rarely box my ears. Afterwards we
marched on further, and there was a second battle, but I
have forgotten what the town was called; there also I
seized and carried off four flags, and knocked down one of
the biggest Colonels in the Cuirassiers, and took him
prisoner. And as our regiment is going to be sent home,
the Sergeant has advised me to ask to be transferred and to
stay on here, for in war it is only sleep you do not get, but
you may eat as much as you can stand, and in this country
there is wine everywhere, for they are a rich nation. We
have also burnt a town and we did not spare even women
or children, nor did I. The church was burnt on purpose,
because they are Catholics, and very wicked people. We are
now going on to the Emperor himself, and that will be the
end of the war, but you take care of the cottage and Franek,
for if you do not take care of it, then I will beat you till
you have learnt what sort of a man I am. I commend you
to God.</p>

Bartłomiej Słowik.<br />
</div></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartek was evidently developing a taste for
war, and beginning to regard it as his proper
trade. He felt greater confidence in himself, and
now went into battle as he might have gone to
his work at Pognębin. Medals and crosses covered
his breast, and although he did not become
a non-commissioned officer, he was universally
regarded as the foremost Private in the regiment.
He was always well disciplined, as before, and
possessed the blind courage of the man who
simply takes no account of danger. The courage
actuating him was no longer of the same kind as
that which had filled him in his first moments of
fury, for it now sprang from military experience
and faith in himself. Added to this his giant
strength could endure all kinds of fatigue,
marches, and overstrain. Men fell at his side,
he alone went on unharmed, only working all the
harder and developing more and more into the
stern Prussian soldier. He now not only fought
the French, but hated them. Some of his other
ideas also changed. He became a soldier-patriot,
blindly extolling his leaders. In another letter to
Magda he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wojtek is divided in his opinion, and so there is a quarrel
between us, do you understand? He is a scoundrel, too,
because he says that the French are Germans, but they are
French, and we are Germans.</p></blockquote>

<p>Magda, in her reply to both letters, set about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
abusing him with the first words that came into
her head.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dearest Bartek (she wrote), married to me before the
holy Altar! May God punish you! You yourself are a
scoundrel, you heathen, going with those wretches to murder
half a nation of Catholics. Do you not understand, then,
that those wretches are Lutherans, and that you, a Catholic,
are helping them? You like war, you ruffian, because you
are able now to do nothing but fight, drink, and illtreat
others, and to go without fasting; and you burn churches.
But may you burn in Hell for that, because you are even
proud of it, and have no thought for old people or children.
Remember what has been written in golden letters in the
Holy Scriptures about the Polish nation, from the beginning
of the world to the Judgment Day,&mdash;when God most High
will have no regard for sluggards,&mdash;and restrain yourself,
you Turk, that I may not smash your head to pieces. I have
sent you five thalers, although I have need of them here,
for I do not know which way to turn, and the household
savings are getting short. I embrace you, dearest Bartek.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Magda.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The moral contained in these lines made little
impression on Bartek. 'The wife does not remember
her vows,' he thought to himself, 'and
is meddling.' And he continued to make war on
the aged. He distinguished himself in every
battle so greatly, that finally he again came under
the honoured notice of Steinmetz. Ultimately
when the shattered Polish regiment was sent back
into the depths of Germany, he took the sergeant's
advice of applying for leave to be transferred, and
stayed behind. The result of this was that he
found himself outside Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>His letters were now full of contempt for the
French. 'They run away like hares in every
battle,' he wrote to Magda, and he wrote the
truth. But the siege did not prove to his taste.
He had to dig or to lie in the trenches round
Paris for whole days, listening to the roar of the
guns, and often getting soaked through. Besides,
he missed his old regiment. In the one to which
he had been transferred as a volunteer, he was
surrounded by Germans. He knew some German,
having already learnt a little at the factory, but
only about five in ten words; now he quickly
began to grow familiar with it. The regiment
nicknamed him 'the Polish dog,' however, and it
was only his decorations and his terrifying fists
which shielded him from disagreeable jokes.
Nevertheless, he earned the respect of his new
comrades, and began little by little to make friends
with them. Since he covered the whole regiment
with glory, they ultimately came to look upon him
as one of themselves. Bartek would always have
considered himself insulted if anyone called him
German, but in thinking of himself in distinction
to the French he called himself 'ein Deutscher.'
To himself he appeared entirely distinct, but at the
same time he did not wish to pass for worse than
others. An incident occurred, nevertheless, which
might have given him plenty to reflect upon, had
reflection come more easily to this hero's mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Some Companies of his regiment had been sent
out against some volunteer sharpshooters, and
laid an ambush for them, into which they fell.
But the detachment was composed of veteran
soldiers, the remains of some of the foreign regiments,
and this time Bartek did not see the dark
caps running away after the first shots. They
defended themselves stubbornly when surrounded,
and rushed forward to force their way through
the encircling Prussian soldiery. They fought so
desperately that half of them cut their way
through, and knowing the fate that awaited captured
sharpshooters, few allowed themselves to
be taken alive. The Company in which Bartek
was serving therefore only took two prisoners.
These were lodged overnight in a forester's house,
and the next day they were to be shot. A small
guard of soldiers stood outside the door, but
Bartek was stationed in the room under the open
window with the prisoners, who were bound.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners was a man no longer
young, with a grey moustache, and a face expressing
indifference to everything; the other appeared
to be about twenty-two years of age. With his
fair moustache yet scarcely showing, his face was
more like a woman's that a soldier's.</p>

<p>'Well, this is the end of it,' the young man
said after a while, 'a bullet through your head&mdash;and
it's all over!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartek shuddered until the rifle in his hand
rattled; the youth talked Polish.</p>

<p>'It is all the same to me,' the second answered
in a gruff voice, 'as I live, all the same! I have
lived so long, I have had enough.'</p>

<p>Bartek's heart beat quicker and quicker under
his uniform.</p>

<p>'Listen, then,' the older man continued, 'there
is no help for it. If you are afraid, think about
something else, or go to sleep. Enjoy what you
can. As God loves me, I don't care!'</p>

<p>'My mother will grieve for me,' the youth
replied low; and, evidently wishing to suppress
his emotion, or else to deceive himself, he began
to whistle. He suddenly interrupted this, and
cried in a voice of deep despair, 'I did not even
say good-bye!'</p>

<p>'Then did you run away from home?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I thought the Germans would be beaten,
so there would be better things coming for
Poland.'</p>

<p>'And I thought the same. But now&mdash;'</p>

<p>Waving his hand, the old man finished speaking
in a low voice, and his last words were overpowered
by the roar of the wind. The night
was dark. Clouds of fine rain swept past from
time to time; the wood close by was black as a
pall. The gale whistled round the corners of the
room, and howled in the chimney like a dog. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
lamp, placed high above the window to prevent
the wind from extinguishing it, threw a flood of
bright light into the room. But Bartek, who was
standing close to it under the window, was
plunged in darkness.</p>

<p>And it was perhaps better the prisoners should
not see his face, for strange things were taking
place in this peasant's mind. At first he had been
filled with astonishment, and had stared hard at
the prisoners, trying to understand what they
were saying. So these men had set out to beat
the Germans to benefit Poland, and he had beaten
the French, in order that Poland might benefit!
And to-morrow these two men would be shot!
How was that? What was a poor fellow to think
about it? But if only he could hint it to them, if
only he could tell them that he was their man,
that he pitied them! He felt a sudden catch in
his throat. What could he do for them? Could
he rescue them? Then <i>he</i> would be shot! Good
God! what was happening to him? He was so
overcome by pity that he could not remain in the
room.</p>

<p>A strange intense longing suddenly came upon
him till he seemed somewhere far off at Pognębin.
Pity, hitherto an unknown guest in his soldier's
heart, cried to him from the depth of his soul:
'Bartek, save them, they are your brothers!' and
his heart, torn as never before, cried out for home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
for Magda, for Pognębin. He had had enough
of the French, enough of this war, and of battles!
The voice sounded clearer and clearer: 'Bartek,
save them!' Confound this war! The woods
showed dark through the open window, moaning
like the Pognębin pines, and even in that moan
something called out, 'Bartek, save them!'</p>

<p>What could he do? Should he escape to the
wood with them, or what? All his Prussian discipline
recoiled in aversion at the thought. In the
Name of the Father and the Son! He need but
cross himself at it! He,&mdash;a soldier, and desert?
Never!</p>

<p>All the while the wood was moaning more
loudly, the wind whistling more mournfully.</p>

<p>The elder prisoner suddenly whispered, 'That
wind&mdash;like the Spring at home.'</p>

<p>'Leave me in peace!' the young man said in
a Pognębin voice.</p>

<p>After a moment, however, he repeated several
times:</p>

<p>'At home, at home, at home! God! God!'</p>

<p>Deep sighs mingled with the listening wind,
and the prisoners lay silent once more.</p>

<p>Bartek began to tremble feverishly. There is
nothing so bad for a man as to be unable to tell
what is amiss with him. It seemed to Bartek as
if he had stolen something, and were afraid of
being taken in charge. He had a clear conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
nothing threatened him, but he was certainly
terribly afraid of something. Indeed, his legs
were trembling, his rifle had grown dreadfully
heavy, and something&mdash;like bitter sobs&mdash;was
choking him. Were these for Magda, or for
Pognębin? For both, but also for that younger
prisoner whom it was impossible to help.</p>

<p>At times Bartek fancied he must be asleep.
All the while the storm raged more fiercely round
the house, and the cries and voices multiplied
strangely in the whistling of the wind.</p>

<p>Suddenly every hair of Bartek's head stood on
end under his helmet. For it seemed as if somewhere
from out of the dark, rain-clad depths of
the forest somebody were groaning, and repeating:
'At home, at home, at home!'</p>

<p>Bartek started back, and struck the floor with
the butt end of his rifle to wake himself. He
regained consciousness somehow and looked up.
The prisoners lay in the corner, the lamp was
burning brightly, the wind was howling,&mdash;all was
in order.</p>

<p>The light fell full on to the face of the younger
prisoner&mdash;a child's or girl's face. As he lay there
with closed eyes, and straw under his head, he
looked as if he were already dead.</p>

<p>Never in his life had Bartek been so wrung
with pity! Something distinctly gripped his throat,
and an audible cry was wrung from his breast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the elder prisoner turned
wearily on to his side, and said, 'Good-night,
Władek.' Silence followed. An hour passed.</p>

<p>The wind played like the Pognębin organ. The
prisoners lay silent. Suddenly the younger prisoner,
raising himself a little by an effort, called,
'Karol?'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Are you asleep?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Listen! I am afraid. Say what you like, but
I shall pray.'</p>

<p>'Pray, then.'</p>

<p>'Our Father, which art in Heaven, hallowed be
Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come.'</p>

<p>Sobs suddenly interrupted the young prisoner's
words, yet the broken voice was still heard:
'Thy&mdash;will&mdash;be&mdash;done!'</p>

<p>'Oh Jesu!' something cried in Bartek, 'Oh
Jesu!'</p>

<p>Impossible! He could stand it no longer.&mdash;Another
moment, and exclaiming 'Lord, I am only
a man!' he had leapt through the window into
the wood. Let come what may! Suddenly
measured steps were heard echoing from the
direction of the hall: it was the patrol, the Sergeant
with it. They were changing the guard!</p>

<p>Next day Bartek was drunk all day from early
morning. The following day likewise....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>But fresh advances, fighting, and marches took
place during the days following, and I am glad
to say that our hero regained his equilibrium. A
certain fondness for the bottle, in which it is
always possible to find pleasure and at times
forgetfulness, remained with him after that night,
however. For the rest, in battle he was more
terrible than ever; victory followed in his wake.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>Some months had <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'passd'">passed</ins>,
and the Spring was
now well advanced. The cherry trees at
Pognębin were in blossom and the young corn was
sprouting abundantly in the fields. One day
Magda, seated in front of the cottage, was peeling
some rotten potatoes for dinner, fitter for cattle
than for human beings. But it was Spring-time,
and poverty had visited Pognębin. That could be
seen too by the saddened and worried look on
Magda's face. Possibly in order to distract herself,
the woman, closing her eyes, sang in a thin,
strained voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">Alas, my Jasieńko has gone to the war! he writes me letters;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Alas, and I his wife write to him,&mdash;for I cannot see him.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The sparrows twittered in the cherry trees as if
they were trying to emulate her. She stopped
her song and gazed absently at the dog sleeping
in the sun, at the road passing the cottage, and
the path leading from the road through the garden
and field. Perhaps Magda glanced at the path
because it led across to the station and, as God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
willed, she did not look in vain that day. A
figure appeared in the distance, and the woman
shaded her eyes with her hand, but she could not
see clearly, being blinded by the glare. Łysek
woke up, however, raised his head, and giving a
short bark, began to grow excited, pricking up
his ears and turning his head from side to side.
At the same moment the words of a song reached
Magda indistinctly. Łysek sprang up suddenly
and ran at full speed towards the newcomer.
Then Magda turned a little pale.</p>

<p>'Is it Bartek,&mdash;or not?'</p>

<p>She jumped up so quickly that the bowl of
potatoes rolled on to the ground: there was no
longer any doubt; Łysek was bounding up to his
shoulder. The woman rushed forward, shouting
in the full strength of her joy: 'Bartek! Bartek!'</p>

<p>'Magda, here I am!' Bartek cried, throwing
her a kiss, and hurrying towards her. He opened
the gate, stumbled over the step so that he all but
fell, recovered himself,&mdash;and they were clasped
in one anothers' arms.</p>

<p>The woman began to speak quickly:</p>

<p>'And I had thought that you would not come
back. I thought "they will kill him!"&mdash;How
are you?&mdash;Let me see. How good to look at
you! You are terribly thin! Oh Jesu! Poor
fellow!&mdash;Oh, my dearest!... He has come
back, come back!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>For one moment she tore herself from his neck
and looked at him, then threw herself on to it
again.</p>

<p>'Come back! The Lord be praised! Bartek,
my darling! How are you? Go indoors! Franek
is at school being teased by that horrid German!
The boy is well. He's as dull in the upper storey
as you are. Oh, but it was time for you to come
back! I didn't know any more which way to turn.
I was miserable, I tell you, miserable! This whole
poor house is going into ruins. The roof is off
the barn. How are you? Oh, Bartek! Bartek!
That I should actually see you, after all! What
trouble I have had with the hay!&mdash;The neighbours
helped me, but they did it to help themselves!
How are you?&mdash;Well? Oh, but I am glad to have
you,&mdash;glad! The Lord watched over you. Go
indoors. By God, it's like Bartek, and not like
Bartek! What's the matter with you? Oh dear!
Oh dear!'</p>

<p>At that instant Magda had become aware of a
long scar running along Bartek's face across his
left temple and cheek and down to his beard.</p>

<p>'It's nothing.&mdash;A Cuirassier did it for me, but
I did the same for him. I have been in hospital.'</p>

<p>'Oh Jesu!'</p>

<p>'Why, it's a mere flea-bite.'</p>

<p>'But you are starved to death.'</p>

<p>'Ruhig!' answered Bartek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>He was in truth emaciated, begrimed and in
rags:&mdash;a true conqueror! He swayed too as he
stood.</p>

<p>'What's wrong with you? Are you drunk?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;am still weak.'</p>

<p>That he was weak, was certain, but he was tipsy
also. For one glass of vodka would have been
sufficient in his state of exhaustion, and Bartek
had drunk something like four at the station.
The result was that he had the bearing of the
true conqueror. He had not been like this formerly.</p>

<p>'Ruhig!' he repeated. 'We have finished the
Krieg. I am a gentleman now, do you understand?
Look here!' he pointed to his crosses and
medals. 'Do you know who I am? Eh? Links!
Rechts! Heu! Stroh! Halt!'</p>

<p>At the word, 'halt,' he gave such a shrill shout
that the woman recoiled several steps.</p>

<p>'Are you mad?'</p>

<p>'How are you, Magda? When I say to you
"how are you" then how are you? Do you know
French, stupid? "Musiu, Musiu!" What is
"Musiu?" I am a "Musiu," do you understand?'</p>

<p>'Man, what's up with you?'</p>

<p>'What's that to you! Was? "Doné diner,"
do you understand?'</p>

<p>A storm began to gather on Magda's brow.</p>

<p>'What rubbish are you jabbering? What's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
this,&mdash;you don't know Polish? That's all through
those wretches. I said how it would be! What
have they done to you?'</p>

<p>'Give me something to eat!'</p>

<p>'Be quick indoors.'</p>

<p>Every command made an irresistible impression
on Bartek; hearing this 'Be quick' he drew
himself up, held his hand stiffly to his side, and,
having made a half-turn, marched in the direction
indicated. He stood still at the threshold, however,
and began to look wonderingly at Magda.</p>

<p>'Well, what do you want, Magda? What do...?'</p>

<p>'Quick! March!'</p>

<p>He entered the cottage, but fell over the threshold.
The vodka was now beginning to go to his
head. He started singing, and looked round the
cottage for Franek, even saying 'Morgen, Kerl,'
although Franek was not there. After that he
laughed loudly, staggered, shouted 'Hurrah!'
and fell full length on the bed. In the evening
he awoke sober and rested, and welcomed Franek,
then, having got some pence out of Magda, he
took his triumphant way to the inn. The glory
of his deeds had already preceded him to Pognębin,
since more than one of the soldiers from
other divisions of the same regiment, having
returned earlier, had related how he had distinguished
himself at Gravelotte and Sedan. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
now when the rumour spread that the conqueror
was at the inn, all his old comrades hastened there
to welcome him.</p>

<p>No one would have recognized our friend
Bartek, as he now sat at the table. He, formerly
so meek, was to be seen striking his fist on the
table, puffing himself out and gobbling like a
turkey-cock.</p>

<p>'Do you remember, you fellows, that time I
did for the French, what Steinmetz said?'</p>

<p>'How could we forget?'</p>

<p>'People used to talk about the French, and be
frightened of them, but they are a poor lot&mdash;<i>was</i>?
They run like hares into the lettuce, and run away
like hares too. They don't drink beer either,
nothing but strong wine.'</p>

<p>'That's it!'</p>

<p>'When we burnt a town they would wring their
hands immediately and cry "Pitié, pitié,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as if
they meant they would give us a drink if we
would only leave them alone. But we paid no
attention to them.'</p>

<p>'Then can one understand their gibberish?'
enquired a young farmer's lad.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't understand, because you are
stupid, but I understand. "Doné di pę!"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Do
you understand?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>'But what did you do?'</p>

<p>'Do you know about Paris? We had one battle
after another there, but we won them all. They
have no good commanders. People say so too.
"The ground enclosed by the hedge is good," they
say, "but it has been badly managed." Their
officers are bad managers, and their generals are
bad managers, but on our side they are good.'</p>

<p>Maciej Kierz, the wise old innkeeper of Pognębin,
began to shake his head.</p>

<p>'Well, the Germans have been victorious in a
terrible war; they have been victorious&mdash;but I
always thought they would be. But the Lord
alone knows what will come out of it for us.'</p>

<p>Bartek stared at him.</p>

<p>'What do you say?'</p>

<p>'The Germans have never cared to consider us
much, anyhow, but, now they will be as stuck up
as if there were no God above them. And they
will illtreat us still more than they do already.'</p>

<p>'But that's not true!' Bartek said.</p>

<p>Old Kierz was a person of such authority in
Pognębin that all the village always thought as
he did, and it was sheer audacity to contradict
him. But Bartek was a conqueror now, and an
authority himself. All the same they gazed at him
in astonishment, and even in some indignation.</p>

<p>'Who are you, to quarrel with Maciej? Who
are you&mdash;?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>'What's Maciej to me? It isn't to such as he
that I have talked, you see! Why, you fellows,
I talked, didn't I, to Steinmetz&mdash;<i>was</i>? But let
Maciej fancy what he likes. We shall be better
off now.'</p>

<p>Maciej looked at the conqueror for a moment.</p>

<p>'You Blockhead!' he said.</p>

<p>Bartek struck his fist on the table, making all
the glasses and pint-pots start up.</p>

<p>'Still, der Kerl da! Heu! Stroh!'</p>

<p>'Silence, no row! Ask the Priest or the Count,
Blockhead.'</p>

<p>'Was the Priest in the war? Or was the Count
there? But I was there. It's not true, boys.
They'll know now how to respect us. Who won
the battle? We won it, I won it. Now they'll give
us anything we ask for. If I had wanted to
become a land-owner in France, I should have
stayed there. The Government knows very well
who gave the French the best beating. And our
regiment was the best. They said so in the
military despatches. So now the Poles will get
the upper hand;&mdash;do you see?'</p>

<p>Kierz waved his hand, stood up, and went out.
Bartek had carried off the victory in the field of
politics also. The young men remaining with
him, regarded him as a perfect marvel. He
continued:</p>

<p>'As if they wouldn't give me anything I want!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
If I don't get it, I should like to know who would!
Old Kierz is a scoundrel, do you see? The
Government commands you to fight, so you must
fight. Who will illtreat me? The Germans? Is
it likely?'</p>

<p>Here he again displayed his crosses and medals.</p>

<p>'And for whom did I beat the French? Not
for the Germans, surely? I am a better man now
than a German, for there's not one German as
strong. Bring us some beer! I have talked to
Steinmetz, and I have talked to Podbielski.
Bring us some beer!'</p>

<p>They slowly prepared for their carouse.</p>

<p>Bartek began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">Drink, drink, drink,</span><br />
<span class="i2">As long as in my pocket</span><br />
<span class="i2">Still the pennies chink!</span><br />
</div>

<p>Suddenly he took a handful of pence from his
pocket.</p>

<p>'Beer! I am a gentleman now.&mdash;Won't you?
I tell you in France we were not so flush of
money;&mdash;there was little we didn't burn, and few
people we didn't put a shot into!&mdash;God doesn't
know which&mdash;of the French&mdash;.'</p>

<p>A tippler's moods are subject to rapid changes.
Bartek unexpectedly raked together the money
from the table, and began to exclaim sadly:</p>

<p>'Lord, have mercy on the sins of my soul!'</p>

<p>Then, propping both elbows on the table, and
hiding his head in his hands, he was silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>'What's the matter?' inquired one of the
drinkers.</p>

<p>'Why was I to blame for them?' Bartek
murmured sadly. 'It was their own look-out. I
was sorry for them, for they were both in my
hands. Lord! have mercy! One was as the
ruddy dawn! next day he was as white as cheese.
And even after that I still&mdash;Vodka!'</p>

<p>A moment of gloomy silence followed. The
men looked at one another in astonishment.</p>

<p>'What is he saying?' one asked.</p>

<p>'He is settling something with his conscience.'</p>

<p>'A man must drink in spite of that war.'</p>

<p>He filled up his glass of vodka once or twice,
then he spat, and his good humour unexpectedly
returned.</p>

<p>'Have you ever stood talking to Steinmetz?
But I have! Hurrah!&mdash;Drink! Who pays? I do!'</p>

<p>'You may pay, you drunkard,' sounded
Magda's voice, 'but I will repay you! Never
fear!'</p>

<p>Bartek looked at his wife with glassy eyes.</p>

<p>'Have you talked to Steinmetz? Who are you?'</p>

<p>Instead of replying to him, Magda turned to
the interested listeners, and began to exclaim:</p>

<p>'Oh, you men, you wretched men, do you see
the disgrace and misery I am in? He came back,
and I was glad to welcome him as a good man,
but he came back drunk. He has forgotten God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and he has forgotten Polish. He went to sleep,
he woke up sober, and now he's drinking again,
and paying for it with my money, which I had
earned by my own work. And where have you
taken that money from? Isn't it what I have
earned by all my trouble and slavery? I tell you
men, he's no longer a Catholic, he's not a man
any more, he's bewitched by the Germans, he
jabbers German, and is just waiting to do harm
to people. He's possessed....'</p>

<p>Here the woman burst into tears; then, raising
her voice an octave higher:&mdash;'He was stupid,
but he was good. But now, what have they done
to him? I looked out for him in the evening, I
looked out for him in the morning, and I have
lived to see him. There is no peace and no mercy
anywhere. Great God! Merciful God!&mdash;If you
had only left it alone,&mdash;if you had only remained
German altogether!'</p>

<p>Her last words ended in such a wail, it was
almost like a cadence. But Bartek merely said:</p>

<p>'Be quiet, or I shall do for you!'</p>

<p>'Strike me, hit my head, hit me now, kill me,
murder me!' the woman screamed, and stretching
her neck forward, she turned to the man.</p>

<p>'And you fellows, watch!&mdash;'</p>

<p>But the men were beginning to disperse. The
inn was soon deserted, and only Bartek and his
wife, with her neck stretched forward, remained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why do you stretch out your neck like a
goose?' murmured Bartek. 'Go home.'</p>

<p>'Hit me!' repeated Magda.</p>

<p>'Well, I shan't hit,' replied Bartek, putting his
hands into his pockets. Here the innkeeper,
wishing to put an end to the quarrel, turned out
one of the lights. The room became dark and
silent. After a while Magda's shrill voice sounded
through the darkness:</p>

<p>'Hit me!'</p>

<p>'I shan't hit,' replied Bartek's triumphant
voice.</p>

<p>Two figures were to be seen going by moonlight
from the inn to the cottage. One of them,
walking in front, was sobbing loudly; that was
Magda; after her, hanging his head and following
humbly enough, went the victor of Gravelotte
and Sedan.</p>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>


<p>Bartek went home so tipsy that for some
days he was unfit for work. This was most
unfortunate for all his household affairs, which
were in need of a strong man to look after them.
Magda did her best. She worked from morning
till night, and the neighbours helped her as well as
they could, but even so she could not make both
ends meet, and the household was being ruined
little by little. Then there were a few small debts
to the German Colonist, Just, who, having at a
favourable moment bought some thirteen acres of
waste land at Pognębin, now had the best property
in the whole village. He had ready money
besides, which he lent out at sufficiently high
interest. He lent it chiefly to the owner of the
property, Count Jarzyński, who bore the nickname
of the 'Golden Prince,' but who was obliged to
keep up his house in a style of befitting splendour
for that very reason. Just, however, also lent to
peasants. For six months Magda had owed him
some twenty thalers, part of which she had borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for her housekeeping, and part to send to
Bartek during the war. Yet that need not have
mattered. God had granted a good harvest, and
it would have been possible to repay the debt out
of the incoming crop, provided that the hands
and the labour were forthcoming. Unluckily
Bartek could not work. Magda did not quite
believe this, and went to the priest for help, thinking
he might rouse her husband; but this was
really impossible. When at all tired, Bartek
grew short of breath and his wounds pained him.
So he sat in front of the cottage all day long,
smoking his clay pipe with the figure of Bismarck
in white uniform and a Cuirassier's helmet, and
gazed at the world with the drowsy eyes of a
man still feeling the effects of bodily fatigue.
He pondered a little on the war, a little on his
victories, on Magda,&mdash;a little on everything, a
little on nothing.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat thus, he heard Franek
crying in the distance on his way home from
school. He was howling till the echoes rang.</p>

<p>Bartek pulled his pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>'Why, Franek, what's the matter with you?'</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' repeated Franek, sobbing.</p>

<p>'Why are you crying?'</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't I cry, when I have had my
ears boxed?'</p>

<p>'Who boxed your ears?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>'Who? Why, Herr Boege!'</p>

<p>Herr Boege filled the post of schoolmaster at
Pognębin.</p>

<p>'And has he a right to box your ears?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so, as he did it.'</p>

<p>Magda, who had been hoeing in the garden,
came through the hedge, and, with the hoe in her
hand, went up to the child.</p>

<p>'What are you saying?' she asked.</p>

<p>'What am I saying&mdash;? If that Boege didn't
call me a Polish pig, and give me a box on the
ears, and say that just as they have beaten the
French now, so they will trample us underfoot,
for they are the strongest. And I had done
nothing to him, but he had asked me who is the
greatest person in the world, and I had said it
was the Holy Father, but he boxed my ears, and
I began to cry, and he called me a Polish pig,
and said that just as they have beaten the
French....'</p>

<p>Franek was beginning it all over again,&mdash;'and
he said, and I said,'&mdash;but Magda covered his
mouth with her hand, and she herself, turning to
Bartek, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you hear? Do you hear? Go to the French
war, then let a German beat your child like a
dog!&mdash;Curse him! Go to the war, and let this
Swabian kill your child!&mdash;You have your reward!...
May....'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Magda, moved by her own eloquence, also
began to cry to Franek's accompaniment. Bartek
stared open-mouthed with astonishment, and could
not bring out a single word, or comprehend in the
least what had happened. How was this? And
what of his victories?&mdash;He sat on in silence for
some moments, then suddenly something leaped
into his eyes, and the blood rushed to his face.
With ignorant people astonishment, like terror,
often turns to rage. Bartek sprang up suddenly,
and jerked out through his clenched teeth:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I will talk to him!'</p>

<p>And he went out. It was not far to go; the
school lay close to the church. Herr Boege was
just standing in front of the verandah, surrounded
by a herd of young pigs, to which he was throwing
pieces of bread.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, about fifty years of age,
still as vigorous as an oak. He was not particularly
stout, but his face was very fat, and he had
a pair of very protruding eyes which expressed
courage and energy.</p>

<p>Bartek went up to him very quickly.</p>

<p>'German, why have you been beating my child?
<i>Was?</i>' he asked.</p>

<p>Herr Boege took a few steps backwards,
measured him with a glance without a shade of
fear, and said phlegmatically:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Begone, Polish prize-fighter!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why have you been beating my child?' repeated
Bartek.</p>

<p>'I will beat you too, you low Polish scoundrel!
I will show you who is master here. Go to the
devil, go to the law,&mdash;begone!'</p>

<p>Bartek, having seized the schoolmaster by the
shoulder, began to shake him roughly, crying in
a hoarse voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you know who I am? Do you know who
did for the French? Do you know who talked to
Steinmetz? Why do you beat my child, you
cursed Swabian dog?'</p>

<p>Herr Boege's protruding eyes glared no less
than Bartek's, but Boege was a strong man, and
he resolved to free himself from his assailant by a
single blow. This blow descended with a loud
smack on the face of the victor of Gravelotte and
Sedan.</p>

<p>At that the man forgot everything. Boege's
head was shaken from side to side with a swift
motion recalling a pendulum, but with this difference
that the shaking was alarmingly rapid. The
formidable vanquisher of Turcos and Zouaves
awoke in Bartek once more. Boege's twelve year
old son, Oscar, a lad as strong as his father, ran
in vain to his assistance. A short, but terrible
struggle took place, in which the son fell to the
ground, and the father felt himself lifted up into
the air. Bartek, raising his hand, held him there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
he himself scarcely knew how. Unluckily the
tub of dishwater, which Herr Boege had been
assiduously mixing for the pigs, stood near. Into
this tub Herr Boege now capsized, and a moment
later his feet were to be seen projecting from it,
and kicking violently. His wife darted out of the
house:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Help, to the rescue!'</p>

<p>The German colonists rushed from the houses
near to their neighbour's assistance. Some of
them fell on Bartek and began to belabour him
with sticks and stones. In the general confusion
which followed it was difficult to distinguish Bartek
from his adversaries: some thirteen bodies
were to be seen rolling round in a single mass,
and struggling convulsively.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, from out of this fighting
mass Bartek burst forth like fury, making towards
the hedge with all his might.</p>

<p>The Germans ran after him, but an alarming
crack was heard in the hedge at the same moment,
and Bartek's iron hands brandished a stout stick.</p>

<p>He returned raging and furious, holding the
stick in the air: they all fled.</p>

<p>Bartek went after them, but luckily did not
overtake anyone. Thus his rage cooled, and he
began to retreat homewards. Ah! if only it had
been the French he had been facing! His retreat
would then have made immortal history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was, he was being attacked by about a
dozen people who, when they had reassembled,
set on him afresh. Bartek retired slowly, like a
wild boar pursued by dogs. He turned round
now and then and stood still: then his pursuers
stood still too. The stick had earned their complete
respect.</p>

<p>They threw stones at him, nevertheless, one of
which wounded Bartek in the forehead. The
blood poured into his eyes, and he felt himself
growing faint. He swayed once or twice, let go
the stick, and fell down.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' cried the Germans.</p>

<p>But by the time they reached him, Bartek had
got up again: then they held back. This
wounded wolf was still dangerous. Besides, he
was now not far from the first cottage, and some
labourers could be seen in the distance hurrying
to the battlefield at full speed. The Germans
retired to their houses.</p>

<p>'What has happened?' enquired the newcomers.</p>

<p>'I have been trying my hand a bit on the
Germans,' Bartek answered. And he fainted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>


<p>It proved a serious affair. The German newspapers
published flaming articles on the
persecutions to which the peaceful German population
was subjected at the hands of the barbarian
and ignorant masses, who were roused by socialist
agitation and religious fanaticism. Boege became
a hero. He, the quiet, gentle schoolmaster,
spreading the light of learning on the far borders
of the Empire; he, the true missionary of culture
amid barbarians, had fallen a first victim to the
riot. It was fortunate that there were a hundred
million Germans to stand up for him, who would
never allow.... And so on.</p>

<p>Bartek did not know what a storm was brewing
over his head. On the contrary, he was in good
spirits; he was certain that he would win at the
trial. For Boege had beaten his child, and had
dealt him the first blow, and it had afterwards
been he who had been attacked from behind!
Surely he had a right to defend himself. They
had also thrown a stone at his head,&mdash;actually
thrown it at him, who had been mentioned in the
daily despatches, who had won the battle of Gravelotte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had talked to Steinmetz himself, and received
so many medals. It is true it never entered his
head that the Germans did not know all this
when they wronged him so greatly, any more
than it occurred to him that Boege could substantiate
his threat to Pognębin that the Germans
would now trample it underfoot in the same way
in which they, the Pognębinites, had so thoroughly
beaten the French whenever they had had
an opportunity. But as for himself, he was
certain that public opinion and the Government
would be in his favour. They would certainly
know who he was, and what he had done during
the war. If he was not a different man to what
he thought him, Steinmetz would espouse his
cause. Since Bartek was the poorer through the
war, and his house in debt, they were, anyhow,
not doing him justice.</p>

<p>All the same, the police from Pognębin rode up
to Bartek's house. They had expected serious
resistance, for as many as five appeared with
loaded revolvers. They were mistaken; Bartek
had not thought of offering any resistance. They
told him to get into the carriage,&mdash;and he got in.
Magda alone was desperate, persistently repeating:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh dear, what did you fight those French for?
You will catch it now, poor fellow, that you will!'</p>

<p>'Be quiet, stupid!' Bartek answered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
smiled quite cheerfully to the passers-by as he
drove along.</p>

<p>'I'll show them who it is they have offended!'
he cried from the carriage.</p>

<p>And, covered with his medals, he drove along
to the trial like a conqueror.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the trial went in his favour.
The judge decided to be lenient under the circumstances:
Bartek was only condemned to three
months' imprisonment.</p>

<p>In addition to this he had to pay a fine of 150
marks to the Boege family and 'other injured
colonists.'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless the prisoner,' wrote the <i>Posener
Zeitung</i> in the Criminal Report, 'showed not the
slightest sign of contrition when the sentence
was passed on him, but poured forth such a stream
of invective, and began to enumerate his so-called
services to the State in such an impudent manner,
that it is surprising these insults to the Court and
the German nation,' etc., etc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bartek in prison quietly recalled
his deeds at Gravelotte, Sedan, and Paris.</p>

<p>We should, however, be doing an injustice in
asserting that Herr Boege's action called forth no
public censure. Very much the reverse. On a
certain rainy morning a Polish Member of Parliament
pointed out with great eloquence that the
attitude of the Government towards the Poles had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
altered in Posen; that, considering the courage
and sacrifice displayed by the Polish regiments
during the war, it would be fitting to have more
regard for justice in the Polish provinces; finally,
that Herr Boege at Pognębin had abused his position
as schoolmaster by beating a Polish child,
calling it a Polish pig, and holding out hopes that
after this war the inhabitants would trample the
native population under foot. The rain fell as the
Member was speaking, and as such weather makes
people sleepy, the Conservatives yawned, the
National-Liberals yawned, the Centre yawned,&mdash;for
they were still being faced by the 'Kultur-Kampf.'</p>

<p>Following immediately on this 'Polish question'
the Chamber proceeded to the order of the day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bartek sat in prison, or rather, he
lay in the prison infirmary, for the blow from
the stone had re-opened the wound which he had
received in the war.</p>

<p>When not feverish, he thought and thought,
like the turkeycock that died of thinking. But
Bartek did not die, he merely did not arrive at
any conclusion.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, during moments,
which Science names 'lucida intervalla,' it occurred
to him that he had perhaps exerted himself
unnecessarily in 'doing for' the French.</p>

<p>Difficult times followed for Magda. The fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
had to be paid, and there was nothing with which
to pay it. The priest at Pognębin offered to help,
but it turned out that there were not quite forty
marks in his money box. The parish of Pognębin
was poor; besides, the good old man never knew
how his money went. Count Jarzyński was not
at home. It was said that he had gone love-making
to some rich lady in Prussia.</p>

<p>Magda did not know where to turn.</p>

<p>An extension of the loan was not to be thought
of. What else, then? Should she sell the horse
or the cows? Meanwhile Winter passed into
Spring, the hardest time of all. It would soon
be harvest, when she would need money for
extra labour, and even now it was all exhausted.
The woman wrung her hands in despair. She
sent a petition to the Magistrate, recalling Bartek's
services; she never even received an answer.
The time for repayment of the loan was drawing
near, and the sequestration with it.</p>

<p>She prayed and prayed, remembering bitterly
the time when they were well off, and when
Bartek used to earn money at the factory in
winter. She tried to borrow money from her
neighbours; they had none. The war had made
itself felt all round. She did not dare to go to
Just, because she was in his debt already, and
had not even paid the interest. However, Just
unexpectedly came to see her himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon she was sitting in the cottage
doorway doing nothing, for despair had drained
her strength. She was gazing before her at two
golden butterflies chasing one another in the air,
and thinking 'how happy those creatures are, they
live for themselves and needn't pay'&mdash;and so on.
After a while she sighed heavily, and a low cry
broke from her pale lips: 'Oh God! God!' Suddenly
at the gate appeared Just's long nose, and
his long pipe beneath it. The woman turned pale.
Just addressed her:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Morgen!'</p>

<p>'How are you, Herr Just?'</p>

<p>'What about my money?'</p>

<p>'Oh, my dear Herr Just, have pity! I am very
poor, and what am I to do? They have taken my
man away,&mdash;I have to pay the fine for him,&mdash;and
I don't know where to turn. It would be
better to die than to be worried like this from day
to day. Do wait a while longer, dear Herr Just!'</p>

<p>She burst out crying, and seizing Herr Just's
fat, red hand, she kissed it humbly. 'The Count
will be back soon, then I will borrow from him,
and give it back to you.'</p>

<p>'Well, and how will you repay the fine?'</p>

<p>'How can I tell?&mdash;I might sell the cow.'</p>

<p>'Then I will lend you some more.'</p>

<p>'May God Almighty repay you, my dear Sir!
Although you are a Lutheran, you are a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
man. I speak the truth! If only other Germans
were like you, Sir, one might bless them.'</p>

<p>'But I don't lend money without interest.'</p>

<p>'I know, I know.'</p>

<p>'Then write me one receipt for it all.'</p>

<p>'You are a kind gentleman, may God repay
you too in the same way.'</p>

<p>'We will draw up the bill when I go into the
town.'</p>

<p>He went into the town and drew up the bill, but
Magda had gone to the priest for advice beforehand.
Yet what could he advise? The priest
said he was very sorry for her; the time given
for repayment was short, the interest was high,
Count Jarzyński was not at home; had he been,
he might have helped. Magda, however, could
not wait until the team was sold, and she was
obliged to accept Just's terms. She contracted a
debt of three hundred marks, that is, twice the
amount of the fine, for it was certainly necessary
to have a few pence in the house to carry on the
housekeeping. On account of the importance of
the document, Bartek was obliged to sign it, and
for this reason Magda went to see him in prison.
The conqueror was very depressed, dejected, and
ill. He had wished to forward a petition, setting
forth his grievances, but petitions were not accepted;&mdash;opinion
in Administrative circles had
turned against him since the Articles in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<i>Posener Zeitung</i>. For were not these very Authorities
bound to afford protection to the peaceful German
population, who, during the recent war, had given
so many proofs of devotion and sacrifice to the
Fatherland? They were therefore obliged in fairness
to reject Bartek's petition. But it is not
surprising that this should have depressed him
at last.</p>

<p>'We are done for all round,' he said to his wife.</p>

<p>'All round,' she repeated.</p>

<p>Bartek began to ruminate deeply on the circumstances.</p>

<p>'It's a cruel injustice to me,' he said.</p>

<p>'That man Boege persecutes one,' Magda replied.
'I went to implore him, and he called me
names too. Ah! the Germans have the upper
hand now at Pognębin. They aren't afraid of
anyone.'</p>

<p>'Of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'couse'">course</ins>, for they are the strongest,' Bartek
said sadly.</p>

<p>'As I am a plain woman, I tell you God is the
strongest.'</p>

<p>'In Him is our refuge,' added Bartek.</p>

<p>They were both silent a moment, then he asked
again:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, and what of Just?'</p>

<p>'If the Lord Almighty gives us a crop, then
perhaps we shall be able to repay him. Possibly
too the Count will help us, although he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
has debts with the German. They said even
before the war that he would have to sell Pognębin.
Let us hope that he will bring home a
rich wife.'</p>

<p>'But will he be back soon?'</p>

<p>'Who knows? They say at the house that he
will soon be coming with his wife. And directly
he is back the Germans will be upon him. It's
always those Germans! They are as plentiful as
worms! Wherever one looks, whichever way one
turns, whether in the village or the town&mdash;Germans
for our sins! But where are we to get help
from?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you can decide on something, for you
are a clever woman.'</p>

<p>'What can I advise? Should I have borrowed
money from Just if I could have helped it? I did
it for a good reason, but now the cottage in which
we are settled, and the land also are already his.
Just is better than other Germans, but he too has
an eye to his own profit, not other people's. He
won't be lenient to us any more than he has been
lenient to others. I am not so stupid as not to
know why he sticks his money in here! But what
is one to do, what is one to do?' she cried, wringing
her hands. 'Give some advice yourself, if
you are clever. You can beat the French, but
what will you do without a roof over your head,
or a crust to eat?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The victor of Gravelotte bent his head. 'Oh
Jesu! Jesu!'</p>

<p>Magda had a kind heart; Bartek's grief touched
her, so she said quickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Never mind, dear boy, never mind. Don't
worry as long as you are not yet well. The rye
is so fine, it's bending to the ground; the wheat
the same. The ground doesn't belong to the
Germans; it's as good as ever it was. The fields
were in a bad state before your quarrel, but now
they are growing so well, you'll see!'</p>

<p>Magda began to smile through her tears.</p>

<p>'The ground doesn't belong to the Germans,'
she repeated once more.</p>

<p>'Magda!' Bartek said, looking at her with
wide-open eyes, 'Magda!'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'But,&mdash;because you are ... if....'</p>

<p>Bartek felt deep gratitude towards her, but he
could not express it.</p>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>


<p>In truth Magda was worth more than ten other
women put together. Her manner towards
Bartek was rather curt, but she was really attached
to him. In moments of excitement, as,
for example, in the prison, she told him to his face
that he was stupid; nevertheless, before other
people she would generally exclaim:&mdash;'My Bartek
pretends to be stupid, but that's his slyness.' She
used frequently to say this. As a matter of fact,
Bartek was about as cunning as his horse, and
without Magda he would have been unable to
manage either his holding or anything else. Now,
when everything rested on her honest shoulders,
she left no stone unturned, running hither and
thither to beg for help. A week after her last
visit to the prison infirmary she ran in again to
see Bartek, breathless, beaming, and happy.</p>

<p>'My word, Bartek, how are you?' she exclaimed
gleefully. 'Do you know the Count has
arrived! He was married in Prussia; the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
lady is a beauty! But he has done well for himself
all round in getting her; fancy,&mdash;just fancy!'</p>

<p>The owner of Pognębin had really been married
and come home with his wife, and had actually
done very well by himself all round in finding her.</p>

<p>'Well, and what of that?' enquired Bartek.</p>

<p>'Be quiet, Blockhead,' Magda replied. 'Oh!
how out of breath I am! Oh Jesu! I went to
pay my respects to the lady. I looked at her:
she came out to meet me like a queen, as young
and charming as a flower, and as beautiful as the
dawn!&mdash;Oh dear, how out of breath I am!&mdash;'</p>

<p>Magda took her handkerchief, and began to
wipe the perspiration from her face. The next
instant she started talking again in a gasping
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>'She had a blue dress like that blue-bottle. I
fell at her feet, and she gave me her hand;&mdash;I
kissed it,&mdash;and her hands are as sweet and tiny as
a child's. She is just like a saint in a picture,
and she is good, and feels for poor people. I
began to beg her for help.&mdash;May God give her
health!&mdash;And she said, "I will do," she said,
"whatever lies in my power." And she has such
a pretty little voice that when she speaks one does
feel pleased. So then I began to tell her that
there are unhappy people in Pognębin, and she
said, "Not only in Pognębin," and then I burst
into tears, and she too. And then the Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
came in, and he saw that she was crying, so he
would have liked to take her and give her a little
kiss. Gentlefolk aren't like us! Then she said to
him, "Do what you can for this woman." And
he said, "Anything in the world, whatever you
wish."&mdash;May the Mother of God bless her, that
lovely creature, may She bless her with children
and with health!&mdash;The Count said at once: "You
must be heavily in debt, if you have fallen into the
hands of the Germans, but," he said, "I will
help you, and also against Just."'</p>

<p>Bartek began to scratch his neck.</p>

<p>'But the Germans have got hold of him too.'</p>

<p>'What of that? His wife is rich. They could
buy all the Germans in Pognębin now, so it was
easy for him to talk like that. "The election,"
he said, "is coming on before long, and people
had better take care not to vote for Germans;
but I will make short work of Just and Boege."
And the lady put her arm round his neck,&mdash;and
the Count asked after you, and said, "if he is ill,
I will speak to the doctor about giving him a
certificate to show that he is unfit to be imprisoned
now. If they don't let him off altogether," he
said, "he will be imprisoned in the winter, but
he is needed now for working the crops." Do
you hear? The Count was in the town yesterday,
and invited the doctor to come on a visit to Pognębin
to-day. He's not a German. He'll write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the certificate. In the winter you'll sit in prison
like a king, you'll be warm, and they'll give you
meat to eat; and now you are going home to
work, and Just will be repaid, and possibly the
Count won't want any interest, and if we can't
give it all back in the Autumn, I'll beg it from
the lady. May the Mother of God bless her....
Do you hear?'</p>

<p>'She is a good lady. There are not many
such!' Bartek said at once.</p>

<p>'You must fall at her feet, I tell you,&mdash;but no,
for then that lovely head would bend to you! If
only God grants us a crop. And do you see
where the help has come from? Was it from the
Germans? Did they give a single penny for your
stupid head? Well, they gave you as much as
it was worth! Fall at the lady's feet, I say!'</p>

<p>'I can't do otherwise,' Bartek replied resolutely.</p>

<p>Fortune seemed to smile on the conqueror once
more. He was informed some days later that for
reasons of health he would be released from prison
until the winter. He was ordered to appear before
the Magistrate. The man who, bayonet in
hand, had seized flags and guns, now began to
fear a uniform more than death. A deep, unconscious
feeling was growing in his mind that he
was being persecuted, that they could do as they
liked with him, and that there was some mighty,
yet malevolent and evil power above him, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
if he resisted, would crush him. So there he
stood before the Magistrate, as formerly before
Steinmetz, upright, his body drawn in, his chest
thrown forward, not daring to breathe. There
were some officers present also: they represented
war and the military prison to Bartek. The
officers looked at him through their gold eye-glasses
with the pride and disdain befitting
Prussian officers towards a private soldier and
Polish peasant. He stood holding his breath, and
the Magistrate said something in a commanding
tone. He did not ask or persuade, he commanded
and threatened. A Member had died in Berlin,
and the writs for a fresh election had been issued.</p>

<p>'You Polish dog, just you dare to vote for
Count Jarzyński, just you dare!'</p>

<p>At this the officers knitted their brows into
threatening leonine wrinkles. One, lighting his
cigar, repeated after the Magistrate 'Just you
dare!' and Bartek the Conqueror's heart died
within him. When he heard the order given,
'Go!' he made a half turn to the left, went out
and took breath. They told him to vote for Herr
Schulberg of Great Krzywda; he paid no attention
to the command, but took a deep breath. For
he was going to Pognębin, he could be at home
during harvest time, the Count had promised to
pay Just. He walked out of the town; the ripening
cornfields surrounded him on every side, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
heavy blades hurtling one another in the wind,
and murmuring with a sound dear to the peasant's
ear. Bartek was still weak, but the sun warmed
him. 'Ah! how beautiful the world is!' this
worn-out soldier thought.</p>

<p>It was not much further to Pognębin.</p>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>


<p>'The Election! The Election!'</p>

<p>Countess Marya Jarzyński's head was full
of it, and she thought, talked and dreamt of
nothing else.</p>

<p>'You are a great politician,' an aristocratic
neighbour said to her, kissing her small hands in
a snake-like way. But the 'great politician'
blushed like a cherry, and answered with a beautiful
smile:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, we only do what we can!'</p>

<p>'Count Józef will be elected,' the nobleman
said with conviction, and the 'great politician'
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I should wish it very much, though not alone
for Józef's sake, but' (here the 'great politician'
dropped her imprudent hands again), 'for the
common cause...'</p>

<p>'By God! Bismarck is in the right!' cried the
nobleman, kissing the tiny hands once more.
After which they proceeded to discuss the canvassing.
The nobleman himself undertook Krzywda
Dolna and Mizerów, (Great Krzywda was lost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
for Herr Schulberg owned all the property there),
and Countess Marya was to occupy herself specially
with Pognębin. She was all aglow with the
<i>rôle</i> she was to fill, and she certainly lost no time.
She was daily to be seen at the cottages on the
main road, holding her skirt with one hand, her
parasol with the other, while from under her skirt
peeped her tiny feet, tripping enthusiastically in
the great political cause. She went into the cottages,
she said to the people working on the road,
'The Lord help you!' She visited the sick, made
herself agreeable to the people, and helped where
she could. She would have done the same without
politics, for she had a kind heart, but she did it
all the more on this account. Why should not
she also contribute her share to the political cause?
But she did not dare confess to her husband that
she had an irresistible desire to attend the village
meeting. In imagination she had even planned the
speech she would make at the meeting. And
what a speech it would be! What a speech!
True, she would certainly never dare to make it,
but if she dared&mdash;why then! Consequently when
the news reached Pognębin that the Authorities
had prohibited the meeting, the 'great politician'
burst into a fit of anger, tore one handkerchief up
completely, and had red eyes all day. In vain
her husband begged her not to 'demean' herself
to such a degree; next day the canvassing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
carried on with still greater fervour. Nothing
stopped Countess Marya now. She visited thirteen
cottages in one day, and talked so loudly
against the Germans that her husband was obliged
to check her. But there was no danger. The
people welcomed her gladly, they kissed her hands
and smiled at her, for she was so pretty and her
cheeks were so rosy that wherever she went she
brought brightness with her. Thus she came to
Bartek's cottage also. Although Łysek did not
bark at her, Magda in her excitement hit him on
the head with a stick.</p>

<p>'Oh lady, my beautiful lady, my dear lady!'
cried Magda, seizing her hands.</p>

<p>In accordance with his resolve, Bartek threw
himself at her feet, while little Franek first kissed
her hand, then stuck his thumb into his mouth
and lost himself in whole-hearted admiration.</p>

<p>'I hope'&mdash;the young lady said after the first
greetings were over,&mdash;'I hope, my friend Bartek,
that you will vote for my husband, and not for
Herr Schulberg.'</p>

<p>'Oh my dear lady!' Magda exclaimed, 'who
would vote for Schulberg?&mdash;Give him the ten
plagues! The lady must excuse me, but when
one gets talking about the Germans, one can't
help what one says.'</p>

<p>'My husband has just told me that he has
repaid Just.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>'May God bless him!' Here Magda turned to
Bartek. 'Why do you stand there like a post?
I must beg the lady's pardon, but he's wonderfully
dumb.'</p>

<p>'You will vote for my husband, won't you?'
the lady asked. 'You are Poles, and we are
Poles, so we will hold to one another.'</p>

<p>'I should throttle him if he didn't vote for him,'
Magda said. 'Why do you stand there like a
post? He's wonderfully dumb. Bestir yourself a
bit!'</p>

<p>Bartek again kissed the lady's hand, but he
remained silent, and looked as black as night.
The Magistrate was in his mind.</p>

<p>The day of the Election drew near, and arrived.
Count Jarzyński was certain of victory. All the
neighbourhood assembled at Pognębin. After
voting the gentlemen returned there from the
town to wait for the priest, who was to bring
the news. Afterwards there was to be a dinner,
but in the evening the noble couple were going to
Posen, and subsequently to Berlin also. Several
villages in the Electoral Division had already
polled the day beforehand. The result would
be made known on this day. The company was
in a cheerful frame of mind. The young lady
was slightly nervous, yet full of hope and smiles,
and made such a charming hostess that everyone
agreed Count Józef had found a real treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in Prussia. This treasure was quite unable at
present to keep quiet in one place, and ran from
guest to guest, asking each for the hundredth
time to assure her that 'Józio would be elected.'
She was not actually ambitious, and it was
not out of vanity that she wished to be the
wife of a Member, but she was dreaming in her
young mind that she and her husband together
had a real mission to accomplish. So her heart
beat as quickly as at the moment of her wedding,
and her pretty little face was lighted up with joy.
Skilfully manœuvering amidst her guests, she
approached her husband, drew him by the hand,
and whispered in his ear, like a child, nicknaming
someone, 'The Hon. Member!' He smiled, and
both were happy at the most trifling word. They
both felt a great wish to give one another a warm
embrace, but owing to the presence of their
guests, this could not be. Everyone, however,
was looking out of the window every moment, for
the question was a really important one. The
former Member, who had died, was a Pole, and
this was the first time in this Division that the
Germans had put up a candidate of their own.
Their military success had evidently given them
courage, but just for that reason it the more concerned
those assembled at the manor house at
Pognębin to secure the election of their candidate.
Before dinner there was no lack of patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
speeches, which especially moved the young hostess
who was unaccustomed to them. Now and then
she suffered an access of fear. Supposing there
should be a mistake in counting the votes? But
there would surely not only be Germans serving on
the Committee! The principal landowners would
simply flock to her husband, so that it would be
possible to dispense with counting the votes. She
had heard this a hundred times, but she still
wished to hear it! Ah! and would it not make
all the difference whether the local population had
an enemy in Parliament, or someone to champion
their cause? It would soon be decided,&mdash;in a short
moment, in fact,&mdash;for a cloud of dust was rising
from the road.</p>

<p>'The priest is coming! The priest is coming!'
reiterated those present. The lady grew pale.
Excitement was visible on every face. They were
certain of victory, all the same this final moment
made their hearts beat more rapidly. But it was
not the priest, it was the steward returning from
the town on horseback. Perhaps he might know
something? He tied his horse to the gate post,
and hurried to the house. The guests and the
hostess rushed into the hall.</p>

<p>'Is there any news?&mdash;Is there any? Has our
friend been elected?&mdash;What?&mdash;Come here!&mdash;Do
you know for certain?&mdash;Has the result been declared?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The questions rose and fell like rockets, but
the man threw his cap into the air.</p>

<p>'The Count is elected!'</p>

<p>The lady sat down on a bench abruptly, and
pressed her hand to her fast beating heart.</p>

<p>'Hurrah! Hurrah!' the neighbours shouted,
'Hurrah!'</p>

<p>The servants rushed out from the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Hurrah! Down with the Germans! Long live
the Member! And my lady the Member's wife!'</p>

<p>'But the priest?' someone asked.</p>

<p>'He will be here directly;' the steward answered,
'they are still counting....'</p>

<p>'Let us have dinner!' the Hon. Member cried.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' several people repeated.</p>

<p>They all walked back again from the hall to the
drawing room. Congratulations to the host and
hostess were now offered more calmly; the lady
herself, however, did not know how to restrain
her joy, and disregarding the presence of others,
threw her arm round her husband's neck. But
they thought none the worse of her for this; on
the contrary, they were all much touched.</p>

<p>'Well, we still survive!' the neighbour from
Mizerów said.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a clatter along the
corridor, and the priest entered the drawing room,
followed by old Maciej, of Pognębin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>'Welcome! Welcome!' they all cried. 'Well,&mdash;how
great?'</p>

<p>The priest was silent a moment; then as it
were into the very face of this universal joy he
suddenly hurled the two harsh, brief words:</p>

<p>'Schulberg&mdash;elected!'</p>

<p>A moment of astonishment followed, a volley of
hurried and anxious questions, to which the priest
again replied:</p>

<p>'Schulberg is elected!'</p>

<p>'How?&mdash;What has happened?&mdash;By what
means?&mdash;The steward said it was not so.&mdash;What
has happened?'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Count Jarzyński was leading poor
Countess Marya out of the room, who was biting
her hankerchief, not to burst into tears or to
faint.</p>

<p>'Oh what a misfortune, what a misfortune!'
the assembled guests repeated, striking their foreheads.</p>

<p>A dull sound like people shouting for joy rose
at that moment from the direction of the village.
The Germans of Pognębin were thus gleefully
celebrating their victory.</p>

<p>Count and Countess Jarzyński returned to the
drawing room. He could be heard saying to his
wife at the door, 'Il faut faire bonne mine,' and
she had stopped crying already. Her eyes were
dry and very red.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>'Will you tell us how it was?' the host asked
quietly.</p>

<p>'How could it be otherwise, Sir,' old Maciej
said, 'seeing that even the Pognębin peasants
voted for Schulberg?'</p>

<p>'Who did so?'</p>

<p>'What? Those here?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes; I myself and everyone saw Bartek
Słowik vote for Schulberg.'</p>

<p>'Bartek Słowik?' the lady said.</p>

<p>'Why, yes. The others are at him now for it.
The man is rolling on the ground, howling, and
his wife is scolding him. But I myself saw how
he voted.'</p>

<p>'From such an enlightened village!' the neighbour
from Mizerów said.</p>

<p>'You see, Sir,' Maciej said, 'others who were
in the war also voted as he did. They say that
they were ordered&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That's cheating, pure cheating!&mdash;The election
is void&mdash;Compulsion!&mdash;Swindling!' cried different
voices.</p>

<p>The dinner at the Pognębin manor house was
not cheerful that day.</p>

<p>The host and hostess left in the evening, but
not as yet for Berlin, only for Dresden.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bartek sat in his cottage, miserable,
sworn at, ill-treated and hated, a stranger even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to his own wife, for even she had not spoken a
word to him all day.</p>

<p>In the autumn God granted a crop, and Herr
Just, who had just come into possession of Bartek's
farm, felt pleased, for he had not done at
all a bad stroke of business.</p>

<p>Some months later three people walked out of
Pognębin to the town, a peasant, his wife, and
child. The peasant was very bent, more like an
old man than an able-bodied one. They were
going to the town because they could not find
work at Pognębin. It was raining. The woman
was sobbing bitterly at losing her cottage, and
her native place. The peasant was silent. The
road was empty, there was not a carriage, not a
human being to be seen; the cross alone, wet
from the rain, stretched its arms above them.&mdash;The
rain fell more and more heavily, dimming the
light.</p>

<p>Bartek, Magda and Franek were going to the
town because the victor of Gravelotte and Sedan
had to serve his term of imprisonment during
the winter, on account of the affair with Boege.</p>

<p>Count and Countess Jarzyński continued to
enjoy themselves in Dresden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2>TWILIGHT</h2>

<h3>STEFAN ŻEROMSKI</h3>


<p>The sun was gliding into a lustrous copper
haze, drawn in wide streaks, like transparent
dust, across the distant scene. It sank
behind some thick red firs left standing at the
edge of a clearing and behind the dark trunks
which lay rotting on the hillside. Its beams still
lighted the corners of a cottage, gilding it and
colouring it scarlet; they penetrated the folds of
grey clouds, and glittered on the water.</p>

<p>A recent storm had laid the marshy plains and
newly cultivated woodlands partly under water.
Here and on the furrows of the stubble-fields and
the fresh autumn ploughing the puddles turned
red and their irridescent surface became like
molten glass, while entrancing violet shadows,
dazzling to the sight, fell on the grey, beaten-down
clods; the sand hills turned yellow; the
weeds growing on the banks, the bushes at the
edge of the field paths, all borrowed some unwonted
momentary colour.</p>

<p>In a deep hollow surrounded by sparsely wooded
hills to the east, west and south ran a little brook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which overflowed into bays, swamps, shallows
and creeks. Tangles of reeds grew at the water's
edge, lank bulrushes, sweet-flags, and clumps of
willows. The still, red water was now shining in
formless pale-green patches from under the large
leaves of the water-lilies and coarse water-weeds.</p>

<p>A flight of teals was hovering above with
outstretched necks, and broke in upon the silence
with the swish of their wings. Otherwise everything
was still. Even the glassy blue dragon-flies,
which had been hovering ceaselessly on their
gossamer wings round the stems of the bulrushes,
had disappeared. The untiring water-flies alone
yet strayed over the illuminated surface of the
swamps on their stilt-like legs.... And there were
two human beings at work.</p>

<p>The marshes belonged to the manor house.
Formerly the young owner, accompanied by his
spaniel, had floundered through them, shooting
ducks and snipe, which were to be found there
before he cut down all the woods. He left quite
half of the land uncultivated, and having very
quickly run through his property, he found no
means of supporting himself until he went to
Warsaw, where he was now selling soda-water
at a stall.</p>

<p>When a new and prudent owner appeared, he
inspected the fields, stick in hand, and frequently
stood still on the marshes, rubbing his nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>He fumbled with his hands in the swamp,
dug holes, measured, sniffed,&mdash;till he invented a
strange thing. He ordered the bailiff to hire
labourers daily to dig peat, to heap barrow-loads
of the mud on to the fields, and to go on digging
a hole until it was large enough for a pond. He
was to make a dyke, and to choose a lower position
for a second pond, till there were some
thirteen in all; then to cut trenches; to let the
water down, build water-gates, and set fish in the
ponds.</p>

<p>Walek Gibała, a day labourer without any land
of his own, who was working for wages in the
neighbouring village, was hired to cart away the
peat. Gibała had been groom to the former landlord,
but had not stayed on with the new one.
In the first place, the new landlord and the new
steward had lowered the wages and allowances,
and, in the second place, they made an enquiry
into everything that was stolen. In the time of
the former landlord each groom used half a bushel
of oats for a pair of horses, and took the rest in
the evening to the 'Berlin' Inn, in exchange for
tobacco or a drop of brandy. However, this
business had come to an end at once when the
new steward appeared, and since he justly laid
the blame of it on Walek, he had boxed his ears,
and dismissed him from his service.</p>

<p>So from that time Walek and his wife had lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on their daily earnings in the village, because he
could not find a situation; he was not likely even
to apply for one, so thoroughly had the steward
taken his character away. At harvest time they
both earned something here and there from the
peasants, but in winter and early spring they
suffered terribly,&mdash;indescribably, from hunger.
Large and bony, with iron muscles, the man was
as thin as a board, with an ashen look, round-shouldered
and weakened by privation. The
woman&mdash;like a woman&mdash;supported herself by her
neighbours; she sold mushrooms, raspberries
and strawberries to the manor house, or to the
Jews, and at least thus earned a loaf of wheat-bread.
But, without food, she was no match for
the man at threshing. When the bailiff gave the
order for digging in the meadows, the eyes of
both sparkled. The steward himself promised
thirty kopeks for digging two cubic yards.</p>

<p>Walek kept his wife occupied with the digging
every day and all day. She loaded the wheelbarrow,
and he wheeled the mud on to the field
along planks thrown across the swamp. They
worked feverishly. They had two large, deep
wheelbarrows, and before Walek had brought
back the empty one, the second was already full;
then he threw the strap round his shoulder and
pushed the barrow up the hill. The iron wheel
creaked horribly. The liquid, dark, rank slime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
thick with marsh-weeds, overflowed and trickled
down on to the man's bare knees, as the wheelbarrows
were tilted from plank to plank; it
penetrated to his neck and shoulders, marking
his shirt with a dark, evil-smelling streak. His
arms ached at the elbows, his feet were painful
and stiff from being continually plunged into the
mud, but&mdash;with a hard day's work, they dug out
four cubic yards:&mdash;and he knew that he had sixty
kopeks in his pocket.</p>

<p>They were hopeful, for they had earned thirty
roubles by the end of the autumn. They paid
their rent, bought a cask of pickled cabbage, five
bushels of potatoes, a 'sukmana,'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> boots, some
aprons and homespun for the woman, and linen
for shirts. Thus they could last till the spring,
when they would be able to earn by threshing and
weaving at other people's houses.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the steward considered it excessive
to give thirty kopeks for two cubic yards. It
struck him that no one would be tempted to patter
about in a swamp from daybreak to nightfall
unless on the verge of starvation, and these people
had undertaken it without hesitation. 'Twenty
kopeks is enough,' he said, 'if not,&mdash;well, go
without.'</p>

<p>There was nothing to be earned at this time of
year, and the manor house had enough of its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
people to attend to the threshing and machinery;&mdash;it
was no use being fastidious in the matter.
After this announcement Walek went to the inn,
and made a beast of himself. Next day he beat
his wife, and dragged her out to work for him.</p>

<p>From that time forward&mdash;beginning when it
grew light&mdash;they dug out the four cubic yards,
never stopping work from daybreak until night.</p>

<p>And now, indeed, night was drawing on from
afar. The distant light-blue woods were growing
dark, and melting into grey gloom. The radiance
on the waters was extinguished. Immense
shadows from the red firs standing towards the
north fell on the summits of the hills, and along
the clearings. The tree trunks alone remained
crimson here and there, and then the stones.
Small, fugitive rays were reflected from these
points of light, and, falling into the deep wastes
created among objects by the half-darkness, were
refracted, quivered for an instant, and went out
in turn. The trees and bushes lost their convexity
and brilliance, their natural colours mingled with
the grey distance, and they appeared only as flat
and completely black forms with weird contours.</p>

<p>A thick mist was already gathering in the low-lying
country, chilling the man through as he
worked. The darkness was coming on in unseen
waves, creeping along the slopes of the hills,
gathering to itself the dreary colours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
stubble-fields, the water-courses, the clefts in the
hills, and the rocks.</p>

<p>As the waves of mist met, others&mdash;white, transparent,
and scarcely visible&mdash;which rose from the
marshes, crept along in streaks, winding in balls
round the undergrowth, trembling and curling
over the surface of the water. The cold, damp
wind drove the mist along the bottom of the
valley, till it was stretched out flat like a face
on the canvas of a picture.</p>

<p>'The mist is coming on,' Walkowa murmured.
It was that moment of twilight, when every form
seems to be visibly reducing itself to dust and
nothingness, when a grey emptiness spreads over
the surface of the earth, looks into the eyes, and
oppresses the heart with unconscious sorrow.
Terror seized Walkowa. Her hair stood on end,
and a shudder passed through her body. The
mists rose like a living thing, stealthily crawling
over towards her; they came up from behind,
retreated, lay in wait, and again crept forward
in more impetuous pursuit. Her hands were
clammy with the damp, it soaked through her
skin to the bone, it irritated her throat, and
tickled her chest. Then she remembered her
child, whom she had not seen since noon. He was
lying asleep,&mdash;locked up in a room quite alone,&mdash;in
a cradle of lime wood, suspended from the
beams of the ceiling by birch-twigs. Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he was crying now,&mdash;choking,&mdash;sobbing? The
mother heard that cry, as wailing and pitiful as
that of a solitary bird in a desert place. It
rang in her ears, it tormented a particular spot
in her brain, it tore at her heart. She had not
thought about him all day, for her hard work had
scattered all her thoughts, in fact, it had drained
and annihilated her power of thinking; but now
the uncanny sensations caused by the twilight
compelled her to concentrate herself and fasten
her mind upon this small morsel of humanity.</p>

<p>'Walek' she said timidly, when the man brought
up the barrow, 'shall I be off to the cottage and
finish scraping the potatoes?'</p>

<p>Gibała did not answer, as though he had not
heard. He seized the barrow and set forth.
When he returned, the woman implored again:
'Walek, shall I be off?'</p>

<p>'Eh?' he grumbled carelessly.</p>

<p>She knew what his anger meant; she knew
that he could catch a man under the ribs, gather
up his skin in handfuls, and, having shaken him
once or twice, throw him down like a stone among
the rushes. She knew he was capable of tearing
the handkerchief from her head, twisting her
hair in a knot round his fist and dragging her
in terror along the road; or, in a fit of absent-mindedness,
of pulling his spade out of the swamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
quickly, and cutting her across the head without
considering&mdash;whether it had hit, or not hit her.</p>

<p>But impatient anxiety, kindled to the point of
pain, rose above the fear of punishment. At
moments the woman thought of running away;
it only meant creeping into the little ravine, leaping
across the brooklet, and then making straight
through the fields and plantations. As she stooped
and filled her barrow, she was already escaping
in thought, leaping like a marten, scarcely feeling
the pain of running barefoot across the stubble,
overgrown with thick blackthorn and blackberries.
The sharp clods would sting not only her feet but
her heart. She would come running to the cottage,
and open the bolt with the wooden key; the
warmth and close air of the room would meet her
face; she would clasp the cradle ... Walek
would kill her when he returned to the cottage,&mdash;beat
her to death:&mdash;but what then? That would
be for later....</p>

<p>As soon, however, as Walek emerged from the
mist, she was seized afresh by a dread of his
fists. Again she humbly begged him, although
she knew that her tormentor would not set her
free:</p>

<p>'Perhaps the baby is dead in there.'</p>

<p>He answered nothing, threw down the strap of
the barrow from his shoulder, approached his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wife, and, by a movement of the head, pointed
to the stakes up to which they must dig that day.
Then he seized the spade, and began to throw
mud into his barrow, time after time. He worked
without thinking, quickly,&mdash;as fast as he could
breathe. When he had filled the barrow he pushed
it forward, running at top speed, and said as he
left:</p>

<p>'Push yours too, you lazy brute....'</p>

<p>She took this mild concession to the object of
her love, this brutal goodness, this hardness and
severity as if it had been a caress. For it would
be possible to finish the work far sooner if they
both wheeled the mud. Rapidly and impetuously
she now imitated his movements, like a monkey,
and shovelled up the mud four times more quickly,
no longer drawing on her muscular peasant's
strength, but on her nervous power. Her chest
rattled, dazzling colours passed under her eyelids,
she felt faint, and large burning tears fell from
her eyes into that cold, evil-smelling filth,&mdash;tears
of unheeded pain. Every time she struck the
spade into the ground she looked to see if it was
still far to the stakes; her barrow ready, she
seized it, and ran at full tilt after the man.</p>

<p>The mists rose high; they drew past the rushes
and stood over the tops of the alders in an unmoving
wall. The trees loomed through them as
patches of indefinite colour, astonishingly large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
but imperfect forms, which ran across the deep
gorge like monstrous, terrible apparitions.</p>

<p>Their heads fell forward; their hands executed
a uniform movement; their bodies were bowed
to the ground....</p>

<p>The wheels of the barrows clattered and whined.
Waves of mist like milk when poured into water,
swayed amid the darkening hills.</p>

<p>The evening star shone low in the sky, and
tremblingly threw its feeble light across the
darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h2>TEMPTATION</h2>

<h3>STEFAN ŻEROMSKI</h3>


<p>Countess Anna Krzywosąd&mdash;Nasławska's
youngest son had decided to take Holy
Orders. From boyhood he had shown an unusual
fondness for prayer, had been silent and obedient,
and worn an earnest, pious expression. He had
been educated in Rome under the eye of a distant
cousin&mdash;a Cardinal&mdash;and completed his course at
the seminary there with distinction, when barely
twenty. Having not yet attained the proper age
to hold any spiritual office, he went back to his
own country for the first time for many years,
and stayed at his mother's house.</p>

<p>He occupied a corner room in the mansion, as
cold and damp as any monastic cell; he slept on
the ground, fasted unceasingly, read Latin books,
very probably scourged himself at nights, and
wore a hair shirt under his shabby cassock. He
was unspeakably good and gentle, forgave injuries,
and was over-modest.</p>

<p>When he sat down, it was on the very edge
of the chair, as if anxious that when he rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
quickly his cassock should hinder him and make
him move like a priest; he walked on tiptoe as
if a mystic heel protected him from the dust of
the earth; he shunned society, he murmured a
prayer at the sight of a village girl.</p>

<p>Every day at dawn he left the house, and went
into the fields. He felt that there he could be in
closest communication with his Creator, there
ecstatic visions came to him most clearly. He
followed the beaten track through numberless
rye-fields to the upland, where a half-ruined little
chapel lay hidden in the shade of the pine forest.</p>

<p>One morning he went there as usual. The
landscape was still buried in the night-mist, but a
violet streak of daybreak had begun to spread on
the horizon. The bearded rye brushed against
his knees and scattered large dewdrops, yet the
pathway was not damp, being sheltered by the
full drooping ears. The corn, feebly illumined by
the early morning light, rose in great waves along
the hill, where the undulating line of the fields
showed against the wood. The scent of earth
and ripening corn hung on the breeze, bringing a
sense of health, strength, and youth. From the
dark gloom of the huge trees, whose tops were
beginning to break up the expanse of dawning
blue, came the keen, damp breath of the forest.
The seminarist walked along slowly and lazily,
passing his hand over the surface of the rye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Sky larks and crested larks rose at his feet, and
dropped again like stones into the thickly-growing
corn.</p>

<p>The dawn was now tinging the horizon with
a rosy light; it burst forth like a wide flash of
lightning, illuminating the rifts and curves in the
dark clouds which lay idly over the wood. Unexpectedly
hundreds of red firs, crowning the summit
of the hill, emerged tall and grand from the
night, their boughs standing out prominently
against the transparent background of blue, as if
stretching out their arms to the approaching sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thrill passed through the earth.
The next moment a puff of wind, the forerunner
of daybreak, stirred the boughs of the firs, and
announced alike to plant, to grass, and corn&mdash;the
coming of the sun.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the earth were quivering, as if
her heart began to beat. Then the wind spread
its wings, and hovered over the scented trunks,
over the osiers and corn in the distance. A long,
soothing moment of death-like silence followed,
and then that mysterious moment of early dawn,
when each living plant glows in its every part
as if on fire.</p>

<p>The student walked with his face turned eastwards.
Words of prayer rose from his heart to
his lips as the sap rises to the bark of the pines
when Spring comes. He went up to the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
chapel, opened the grey wooden door, studded
with nails, and fell on his face with outstretched
hands before the picture of Christ, clumsily drawn
by a rustic hand.</p>

<p>He felt as if his soul had fled from earth to the
very Throne of God. The scales had fallen from
his eyes in a moment: he was gazing on the face
of the Eternal.</p>

<p>All at once a rough, coarse peasant's song was
heard:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'It was then that I liked you best, Hanka,</span><br />
<span class="i2">When you bleached yourself in the fields, in the fields, like a gosling.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>This was answered by a woman's voice, approaching
from a distance:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'I did not bleach myself, I bleached a linen shirt,</span><br />
<span class="i2">But you, Kaśka, thought that I was painted.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>The young man rose from the ground, and
stood at the door of the chapel. He saw a sturdy
farmer's lad in shirt sleeves, bare-foot, in a
straw hat, and loaded like a horse, with juniper
wood. This strapping fellow was taking up a
kilo of roots&mdash;digging out bushes with the clods,
and moistening his hands in the branches. A girl
was going along the path, carrying a load of
weeds on her back. The corners of her petticoat
were turned up and tucked into her belt, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
broad shoulders were bent together under the
heavy burden, only her head, tied round with a
red handkerchief, was raised towards the hill
where the lad was working. When she reached
the turn of the path, he stopped her, pulled down
the hem of her skirt from her waist, and laid her
bundle on the ground. She pushed him away
with her hands, laughing.</p>

<p>The student shaded his eyes with his hand, but
dropped it again the next minute, as the sound of
the two singing a fresh song echoed through the
glade. It was strange music. The wood, like a
tuned string, seemed to quiver in harmony with
the sound of those two voices:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'In the garden is a cherry tree,</span><br />
<span class="i2">In the orchard there are two;</span><br />
<span class="i2">I have loved you, Hanuś, since you were small,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Nobody else but you.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>They went down into the hollow through the
corn, which reached up to their heads, bent towards
one another. Those two heads stood out
in sharp relief against the dark rye, while the
giant, brazen shield of the sun was rising over
the ridge. They walked thus for a long time,
never completely hidden by the corn.</p>

<p>Tears flowed from under the young man's
closed eyes, and he clenched his hands convulsively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Words unknown to him, words known as
longing and the desire for love, forced themselves
unnoticed to his lips.</p>

<p>In a vision he saw moist eyes and a girl's long
braided hair rising and sinking in some sea
cavern. An unknown force, inexpressibly sweet,
a force which could be neither expelled nor conquered,
rose within him, carrying him far away
into space. His soul threw off its fetters, and
rushed forth in its wild freedom, as a colt starts
for a mad gallop....</p>

<h2>SRUL&mdash;FROM LUBARTÓW</h2>

<h3>ADAM SZYMAŃSKI</h3>

<h3>I</h3>


<p>It happened in the year,...; but no matter
what year. Suffice it to say that it happened,
and that it happened at Yakutsk in the beginning
of November, about a month after my arrival at
that citadel of frosts. The thermometer was
down to 35 degrees Réamur. I was therefore
thinking anxiously of the coming fate of my nose
and ears, which, fresh from the West, had been
making silent but perceptible protests against
their compulsory acclimatization, and to-day were
to be submitted to yet further trials. These latest
trials were due to the fact that one of the men
in our colony, Peter Kurp, nicknamed Bałdyga,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
had died in the local hospital two days before,
and early that morning we were going to do him
a last service, by laying his wasted body in the
half-frozen ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>I was only waiting for an acquaintance, who
was to tell me the hour of the funeral, and I had
not long to wait. Having wrapped up my nose
and ears with the utmost care, I set out with the
others to the hospital.</p>

<p>The hospital was outside the town. In the
courtyard, and at some distance from the other
buildings, stood a small shed&mdash;the mortuary.</p>

<p>In this mortuary lay Bałdyga's body.</p>

<p>When the doors were opened, we entered, and
the scene within made a painful impression on
the few of us present. We were about ten people,
possibly a few more, and we all involuntarily
looked at one another: we were standing opposite
a cold and bare reality, not veiled by any vestige
of pretence....</p>

<p>In the shed,&mdash;which possessed neither table
nor stool, nothing but walls white with hoarfrost
and a floor covered with snow,&mdash;lay a large
bearded corpse, equally white, and tied up in some
kind of sheet or shirt. This was Bałdyga.</p>

<p>The body, which was completely frozen, had
been brought near the light to the door, where
the coffin was standing ready.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget Bałdyga's face as I saw
it then with the light full upon it, and washed
by the snow. There was something strange and
indescribably sad in the rough, strongly marked
countenance; the large pupils and projecting eyeballs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
seemed to look far away into the distance
towards the stern frosty sky.</p>

<p>'That man,&mdash;he was a good sort,' one of those
present said to me, noticing the impression which
the sight of Bałdyga made on me. 'He was
always steady and industrious; people who were
hard up used to go to him and he would help
them. But there never was anyone so obstinate
as Kurp: he believed to the last that he would
go back to the Narev.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Yet before the end came
it was plain that he knew he would never get
there.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile the petrified body had been laid in
the coffin, and placed upon the small one-horse
Yakut sledge.</p>

<p>Then the tailor's wife&mdash;a person versed in
religious practices,&mdash;undertook the office of priest
for such time as we could give her, and began
to sing 'Ave Maria,' while we joined in with
voices broken with emotion. After this we proceeded
to the cemetery.</p>

<p>We walked quickly; the frost was invigorating,
and made us hasten our steps. At last we reached
the cemetery. We each threw a handful of frozen
earth on to the coffin.... A few deft strokes
of the spade ... and in a moment only a small
freshly turned mound of earth remained to bear
witness to Bałdyga's yet recent existence in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
world. This witness would not last long, however,&mdash;scarcely
a few months. The spring would
come, and, thawed by the sun, the mound on the
grave would sink and become even with the rest
of the ground, and grass and weeds would grow
upon it. After a year or two the witnesses of
the funeral would die, or be dispersed throughout
the wide world, and if even the mother who bore
him were to search for him, she would no longer
find a trace on the earth. But, indeed, none
would seek for the dead man, nor even a dog
ask for him.</p>

<p>Bałdyga had known this; we knew it too:
and we dispersed to our houses in silence.</p>

<p>The day following the funeral the frost was
yet more severe. There was not a single building
to be seen on the opposite side of the fairly
narrow street in which I lived, for a thick mist
of snow crystals overspread the earth, like a
cloud. The sun could not penetrate this mist,
and although there was not a living soul in the
street, the air was so highly condensed through
the extreme cold that I continually heard the
metallic sound of creaking snow, the sharp reports
of the walls and ground cracking in the frost, or
the moaning song of a Yakut. Evidently those
Yakut frosts were beginning, which reduce the
most terrible Arctic cold to insignificance. They
fill human beings with unspeakable dread. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
living thing feels its utter helplessness, and
although it cowers down and shrinks into itself
for protection, knows quite well&mdash;like the cur
worried by fierce mastiffs,&mdash;that all is in vain, for
sooner or later the inexorable foe is bound to be
victorious.</p>

<p>And Bałdyga was continually in my mind, as if
he were alive. I had sat for hours at my half-finished
task. Somehow I could not stick to
work; the pen fell from my hand, and my unruly
thoughts ranged far away beyond the snowy
frontier and frosty ground. In vain I appealed
to my reason, in vain I repeated wholesome
advice to myself for the tenth time. Hitherto
I had offered some resistance to the sickness
which had consumed me for several weeks; to-day
I felt completely overcome and helpless. Homesickness
was devouring and making pitiless havoc
of me.</p>

<p>I had been unable to resist dreaming so many
times already; was it likely I should withstand
the temptation to-day? The temptation was
stronger, and I was weaker than usual.</p>

<p>So begone frost and snow, begone the existence
of Yakutsk! I threw down my pen, and surrounding
myself with clouds of tobacco smoke,
plunged into the waters of feverish imagination.</p>

<p>And how it carried me away!... My
thoughts fled rapidly to the far West, across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
morasses and steppes, mountains and rivers,
across countless lands and cities, and spread a
scene of true enchantment before me. There on
the Vistula lay my native plains, free from misery
and human passions, beautiful and harmonious.
My lips cannot utter, nor my pen describe their
charm!</p>

<p>I saw the golden fields, the emerald meadows;
the dense forests murmured their old legends to
me.</p>

<p>I heard the rustle of the waving corn; the
chirping of the feathered poets; the sound of
the giant oaks as they haughtily bid defiance to
the gale.</p>

<p>And the air seemed permeated by the scent of
those aromatic forests, and those blossoming
fields, adorned in virgin freshness by the blue
cornflowers and that sweetest beauty of Spring,&mdash;the
innocent violet.</p>

<p>... Every single nerve felt the caress of my
native air.... I was touched by the life-giving
power of the sun's rays; and although the frost
outside creaked more fiercely, and showed its
teeth at me on the window panes more menacingly,
yet the blood circulated in my veins more
rapidly, my head burnt, and I sat as if spellbound,
deaf, no longer seeing or hearing anything round
me....</p>



<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<h3>II</h3>


<p>I did not notice that the door opened and
someone entered my room, neither did I see the
circles of vapour, which form in such numbers
every time a door is opened that they obscure the
face of the person entering. I did not feel the
cold: it penetrates human dwellings here with a
sort of shameless, premeditated violence. In fact,
I had seen or heard nothing until suddenly I felt
a man close to me, and even before catching sight
of him, found myself involuntarily putting him
the usual Yakut question:</p>

<p>'Toch nado?' ('What do you want?')</p>

<p>'If you please, Sir, I am a hawker,' was the
answer.</p>

<p>I looked up. Although he was dressed in ox
and stag's hide, I had no doubt that a typical
Polish Jew from a small town stood before me.
Anyone who had seen him at Lossitz or Sarnak
would have recognized him as easily in Yakut
as in Patagonian costume. I knew him at once.
And since, as I have said, I was as yet only semi-conscious,
and had asked the question almost
mechanically, the Jew now standing before me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
did not interrupt my train of thought too harshly;
the contrast was, therefore, not too disagreeable.
Quite the reverse. I gazed into the well-known
features with a certain degree of pleasure; the
Jew's appearance at that moment seemed quite
natural, since it carried me in thought and feeling
to my native land, and the few Polish words
sounded dear to my ear. Half dreaming still,
I looked at him kindly.</p>

<p>The Jew stood still for a moment, then turned,
and retreating to the door, began to pull off his
multifarious coverings.</p>

<p>Then I came to myself, and realized that I
had not yet answered him, and that my sagacious
countryman, quite misinterpreting my silence, was
anxious to dispose of his wares to me. I hastened
to undeceive him.</p>

<p>'In heaven's name, man, what are you doing?'
I cried quickly, 'I do not want to buy anything;
I am not wanting anything. Do not unload yourself
in vain, and go away with God's blessing!'</p>

<p>The Jew stopped undoing his things, and after
a moment's consideration, came towards me with
his long fur coat<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> half trailing behind him, and
began to mumble quickly in broken sentences:
'It's all right; I know you won't buy anything,
Sir. I saw you, for I have been here a long
time, a very long time.... I didn't know before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that you had come.... You come from Warsaw,
don't you, Sir? They only told me yesterday
evening that you had been here four months
already; what a pity it was such a time before
I heard of it! I should have come at once. I
have been searching for you to-day for an hour,
Sir. I went quite to the end of the town,&mdash;and
there's such a frost here,&mdash;confound it!... If
you will allow me Sir,&mdash;I won't interrupt for
long?... Only just a few words....'</p>

<p>'What do you want of me?'</p>

<p>'I should only like to have a little chat with
you, Sir.'</p>

<p>This answer did not greatly surprise me. I
had already come across not a few people, Jews
among them, who had called solely for the purpose
of 'having a little chat' with a man recently
arrived from their country. Those who came
were interested in the most varied topics imaginable;
there were the inquisitive gossipers pure
and simple, there were the people who only enquired
after their relations, and there were the
politicians, including those whose heads had been
turned. Among those who came, however, politics
always played a specially important part. So it
did not surprise me, I repeat, to hear the wish
expressed by a fresh stranger, and although I
should have been glad to rid my cottage as quickly
as possible of the unpleasant odour of the ox-hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
coat,&mdash;badly tanned, as usual&mdash;I begged him in
a friendly way to take it off and sit down.</p>

<p>The Jew was evidently pleased. He took a
seat beside me at once and I could now observe
him closely.</p>

<p>All the usual features of the Jewish race were
united in the face beside me: the large, slightly
crooked nose and penetrating hawk's eyes, the
pointed beard of the colour of a well-ripened
pumpkin, the low forehead, surrounded by thick
hair; all these my guest possessed. And yet,
strange to say, the haggard face expressed a
certain frank sincerity, and did not make a disagreeable
impression on me.</p>

<p>'Tell me where you come from, what your name
is, what you are doing here, and why you wish
to see me?'</p>

<p>'Please, Sir, I am Srul, from Lubartów. Perhaps
you know it,&mdash;just a stone's throw from
Lublin?&mdash;Well, at home everyone thinks it a long
way from there, and formerly I thought so too.
But now,' he added with emphasis, 'we know
that Lubartów is quite close to Lublin, a mere
stone's throw.'</p>

<p>'And have you been here long?'</p>

<p>'Very long; three good years.'</p>

<p>'That is not so very long; there are people
who have lived here for over 20 years, and I met
an old man from Vilna in the road, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
here close upon 50 years. Those have really been
a long time.'</p>

<p>But the Jew snubbed me. 'As to them, I can't
say. I only know that I have been here a long
time.'</p>

<p>'You must certainly live quite alone, if the time
seems so long to you?'</p>

<p>'With my wife and child&mdash;my daughter. I
had four children when I set out, but, may the
Lord preserve us, it was such a long way, we
were travelling a whole year. Do you know what
such a journey means, Sir?... Three children
died in one week&mdash;died of travelling, as it were.
Three children!... An easy thing to say!... There
was nowhere even to bury them, for there
was no cemetery of ours there.... I am a
Husyt,' he added more quietly. 'You know
what that means Sir?... I keep the Law
strictly ... and yet God punishes me like this....'
He grew silent with emotion.</p>

<p>'My friend,' I tried to say to console him a
little,&mdash;'no doubt under such circumstances it is
difficult to remember that it makes no difference;
but all earth is hallowed.'</p>

<p>But the Jew jumped as if he had been scalded.</p>

<p>'Hallowed! how hallowed! In what way is it
hallowed! What are you saying, Sir? It's unclean!
It's damned!... Hallowed earth?...
You must not talk like that, Sir, you ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
be ashamed! Is earth hallowed, which never
thaws? This earth is cursed! God doesn't wish
human beings to live here; it wouldn't have been
like this, if He had wished it. Cursed! Bad!
Damned! Damned!'</p>

<p>And he began to spit about him, and stamp
his feet, threatening the innocent Yakut earth
with tightened lips and his shrivelled hands, and
muttering Jewish maledictions. At last, exhausted
by the effort, he fell rather than sat
down at the table beside me.</p>

<p>All exiles, without regard to religion or race,
dislike Siberia: evidently a fanatic does not learn
to hate it half-heartedly. I paused until he had
calmed himself. Educated in a severe school, the
Jew quickly regained his self-possession and
mastered his emotion, and when I gazed questioningly
into his eyes the next moment, he
immediately answered me:</p>

<p>'You must pardon me; I do not speak of this
to anyone, for to whom should I speak here?'</p>

<p>'Then are there very few Jews here?'</p>

<p>'Those here? Do you call them Jews, Sir?
They're such low fellows, not one of them keeps
the Law strictly.'</p>

<p>Fearing another outburst, I would not, however,
allow him to finish, and decided to change
the conversation by asking him straight out what
he wanted to talk to me about now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>'I should like to know the news from there,
Sir. I have been here so many years, and I have
never yet heard what is going on there.'</p>

<p>'You are asking a good deal, for I can't exactly
tell you everything. I don't know what interests
you,&mdash;politics perhaps?'</p>

<p>The Jew was silent.</p>

<p>I concluded that my present guest, like many of
the others, was interested in politics; but as I
myself did not understand the very elements of
the subject, I began to give the stereotyped
account I had already composed with a view to
frequent repetition of the situation of European
politics, our own,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and so forth. But the Jew
fidgeted impatiently.</p>

<p>'Then this does not interest you?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I have never thought about it,' he answered
candidly.</p>

<p>'Ah, now I know why you have come! I am
sure you wish to know how the Jews are doing,
and how trade is going?'</p>

<p>'They are better off than I am.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. I am sure, under the circumstances,
you will wish to know if living is dear with us,
what the market prices are, how much for butter,
meat, etc.'</p>

<p>'What does it concern me if it is ever so cheap
there, if I can get nothing here?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>'Quite right again; but what the devil did you
actually come here for?'</p>

<p>'Since I don't know myself, I ask you, Sir, how
I am to tell you? You see, Sir, I often get thinking ... I
think so much ... that Ryfka (that's
my wife) asks, "Srul, what's the matter with
you?" And what can I tell her, for I don't know
myself what it is. Perhaps some people would
laugh at me?' he added, as if fearing I were
amongst them.</p>

<p>But I did not laugh; I was interested. Something,
the cause of which he himself could not
explain or express in words, was evidently weighing
on him, and his unusually poor command of
language added to this difficulty. In order to
help him I re-assured him by telling him that I
was in no hurry, as my work was not urgent and
there would therefore be no harm in our having
an hour's talk, and so on.&mdash;The Jew thanked me
with a glance, and after a moment's thought
opened the conversation thus:</p>

<p>'When did you leave Warsaw, Sir?'</p>

<p>'According to the Russian calendar, at the end
of April.'</p>

<p>'Was it cold there then or warm?'</p>

<p>'Quite warm. I travelled in a summer suit
at first.'</p>

<p>'Well, just fancy, Sir! Here it was freezing!'</p>

<p>'Then you have forgotten, is that it? Anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with us the fields are sown in April, and all the
trees are green.'</p>

<p>'Green?' Joy shone in Srul's eyes. 'Why,
yes, yes&mdash;green:&mdash;and here it was freezing!'</p>

<p>Now at last I knew why he had come to me.
Wishing to make certain, however, I was silent:
the Jew was evidently getting animated.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir, you might tell me if there is any&mdash;with
us now ... but you see, I don't know what
it's called; I have already forgotten Polish,' he
apologized shyly, as if he had ever known it&mdash;'it's
white like a pea blossom, yet it's not a pea,
and in summer it grows in gardens round houses,
on those tall stalks?'</p>

<p>'Kidney beans?'</p>

<p>'That's just it! Kidney beans! Kidney beans!'
he repeated to himself several times, as if wishing
to impress those words on his memory for ever.</p>

<p>'Of course there are plenty of those. But are
there none here?'</p>

<p>'Here! I have never seen a single pod all these
past three years. Here the peas are what at
home we should not expect the ... the....'</p>

<p>'The pigs to eat,' I suggested.</p>

<p>'Well, yes! Here they sell them by the pound,
and it's not always possible to get them.'</p>

<p>'Are you so fond of kidney beans?'</p>

<p>'It's not that I am so fond of them, but they
are so beautiful that ... I don't know why ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I often get thinking and thinking how they may
be growing round my house. Here there's
nothing!'</p>

<p>'And now, Sir,' he recommenced, 'will you tell
me, if those small grey birds are still there in the
winter,&mdash;like this&mdash;' and he measured with his
hand. 'I have forgotten their names too. Formerly
there were a great many, when I used to
pray by the window. They used to swarm round!
Well, whoever even looked at them there? Do
you know, Sir, I could never have believed that
I should ever think about them! But here, where
it's so cold that even the crows won't stop, you
can't expect to see little things like that. But
they are sure to be there with us? They are there,
aren't they, Sir?...'</p>

<p>But I did not answer him now. I no longer
doubted that this old fanatical Jew was pining for
his country just as much as I was, and that we
were both sick with the same sickness. This
unexpected discovery moved me deeply, and I
seized him by the hand, and asked in my turn:</p>

<p>'Then that was what you wished to talk to me
about? Then you are not thinking of the people,
of your heavy lot, of the poverty which is pinching
you; but you are longing for the sun, for the air
of your native country!... You are thinking
of the fields and meadows and woods; of the little
songsters, for whom you could not spare a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
moment's attention there when you were busy,
and now that these beautiful pictures are fading
from your recollection, you fear the solitude surrounding
you, the vast emptiness which meets
you and effaces the memories you value? You
wish me to recall them to you, to revive them;
you wish me to tell you what our country is
like?...'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, Sir, yes, Sir! That was why I came
here,' and he clasped my hands, and laughed
joyfully, like a child.</p>

<p>'Listen, brother....'</p>

<p>And my friend, Srul, listened, all transformed
by listening, his lips parted, his look rivetted to
mine; he kindled, he inspired me by that look;
he wrested the words from me, drank them in
thirstily, and laid them in the very depth of his
burning heart.... I do not doubt that he laid
them there, for when I had finished my tale he
began to moan bitterly, 'O weh mir! weh mir!'
He struck his red beard, and in his misery tears
like a child's rolled fast down his face.... And
the old fanatic sat there a long time sobbing, and
I cried with him....</p>

<p>Much water has flowed down the cold Lena
since that day, and not a few human tears have
rolled down suffering cheeks. All this happened
long ago. Yet in the silence of the night, at
times of sleeplessness, the statuesque face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Bałdyga, bearing the stigma of great sorrow,
often rises before me, and invariably beside it
Srul's yellow, drawn face, wet with tears. And
when I gaze longer at that night-vision, many a
time I seem to see the Jew's trembling, pale lips
move, and I hear his low voice whisper:</p>

<p>'Oh Jehovah, why art thou so unmerciful to
one of Thy most faithful sons?...'</p>

<h2>IN AUTUMN</h2>

<h3>WACŁAW SIEROSZEWSKI</h3>


<p>The rain and bad weather, which had continued
without interruption for several days,
had kept the inhabitants of the hut, 'Talaki,'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
prisoners indoors, and condemned them to idleness.
They constantly went out of the room
to gaze long and sadly at the weeping sky, for
the hay was rotting in the fields;&mdash;but alas!
a grey film of rain hung over all the surrounding
country, and in vain their eyes sought longingly
for the smallest chink of blue in the heavy, dark
clouds.</p>

<p>To add to the misfortune, the rain, not content
with the holes left in the roof from the year before,
made a number of fresh ones. It thus poured
into the room from all sides on to people's heads
and shoulders, and formed quite a deep and ever-growing
pool underfoot. Various forms of filth,
remains of food, refuse of fish and game, the
dung in the corner where the calves were kept,
which had been trodden down and had dried in the
course of the year, became moist, and filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
interior of the 'yurta'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> with an unbearable smell.
It was therefore stuffy, cold, and damp there.
The fire, burning rather slowly, was choked by
balls of grey smoke, which went across the room.</p>

<p>The hut was tiny; it occupied no more than
twenty-four square yards of the solitude surrounding
it. The slanting walls, made of barked
larch trees placed perpendicularly, and narrowing
towards the top, diminished its size still more.
The flat roof was built of rafters of the same
wood, and came down so close to the inhabitants'
heads that one of them, Michawio, a big lad,
while unwinding a bundle of nets at the little
window, hit his curly shock head against it.</p>

<p>A plank partition, hewn out with a hatchet,
ran through the centre of the room, and divided
it into equal parts, the right being for the men,
the left for the women. By a post at the end of
the room, with his face turned towards the fire,
his hands on his right knee, and smoking a pipe,
sat my host, Kyrsa,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> a Yakut. Still hale, though
no longer young, he was the wealthy and independent
master of field labourers, and the owner of
the house, of many nets, animals, and implements,
as well as of three women:&mdash;a wife, and two
daughters. The youngest was sold already, but
she was living with her father, as the sum agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
upon for her had not yet been paid in full by the
buyer.</p>

<p>There was deep silence in the room,&mdash;a rather
unusual thing in a place where several Yakut
people are together. The fire roared and hissed
in the chimney, and behind the partition the girls
made a squeaking sound as they rubbed the skins
together. I had a foreboding that this silence
would end badly; indeed, the storm soon broke
out. The lad nicknamed 'Shmata' brought it on
by his incompetence. After wandering from corner
to corner all day, he now upset a bucket and
spilt the water. This was the last straw. All
eyes flashed, and faces grew pale.</p>

<p>The frightened Shmata tried to lay the blame
on Michawio, who had been stooping down near
him to look for a strap. Michawio in revenge
reminded Shmata of what had happened about
the rake the year before. The quarrel had begun
in earnest. Their tongues, moving with the speed
of a windmill, and throwing out invectives and
sneers, formed an accompaniment to the host's
threatening shouts, which rang out like the trump
of the Archangel. Nor did our hostess fail to
leave her seclusion to take part in the skirmish
with the excitement peculiar to women all the
world over. The yurta suddenly became like a
disturbed beehive. The host affirmed, the hostess
denied, the labourers hurled abuses at one another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the girls uttered war cries, the baby woke up and
screamed in its cradle, and the calves lowed in
answer to the loud mooing of the cows, whom
evening had driven near the house door. This last
occurence had a perceptible influence in diminishing
the noise, for it caused the female element
to withdraw from the fight; in fact, the disturbance
might have been conjured away completely,
if the happy thought of adding something at the
very moment when everyone else was quieting
down, had not entered our host's head.</p>

<p>This remark burst out unexpectedly, like a
belated bomb after a battle, and produced such
a din that the cows and calves were silent, the
wind abated in fright, the clouds fled, and I
became aware of a golden sunbeam penetrating
the holes in the bladder at the window, and falling
suddenly into the interior of our dark, dirty, noisy
hovel. Merrily and brightly it rested in a shining
circle on the closely cropped grey head of my host,
before whose nose his wife's large closed fist was
hovering at that moment. 'That's for you! Take
that! Go on!' Kuimis cried, still beautiful in
her anger. The fist came closer and closer to
the unfortunate man's mouth.</p>

<p>What happened further? Did Kyrsa avenge
himself like a man for that greatest of all insults
possible to a Yakut from a woman? Or did he
show himself to be the 'wife of his wife,' an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
woman and a simpleton, as the neighbours called
him, and refrain from knocking out the teeth or
breaking the ribs of the active woman by whose
work he lived and had grown rich? I do not
know, because, foreseeing the overthrow of my
friend, in whom love for his wife was always
struggling against a sense of duty, and not wishing
to be a witness of his defeat, I shouldered my
gun and went out of the cottage.</p>

<p>The wind had dropped, the covering of clouds
was torn open, and bits of pale blue sky were
unveiled here and there. The sun peeped out
suddenly through one of these little gaps, and the
landscape, which had been dreary and joyless a
moment before, brightened into a golden splendour.
A light shadow, half cheerful, half sombre,
fell across its faded autumn foliage, and in this
half smile it resembled a forsaken woman, to
whom the caprice of a lover, who has already
grown cold, offers a moment of tenderness and
happiness again. Drops of rain glistened like
brilliants on the dark branches of the trees and
bushes; the sky was coloured in shades of carmine,
and the pearly tears of the passing storm
trembled on the willows, still swaying from it.</p>

<p>Before me, between two high promontories
overgrown by woods which ran in opposite directions,
sparkled the surface of the lake. In
proportion as it stretched into the distance, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
bank became more winding, lower, and mistier,
until it disappeared at the outlet of a gorge.
Owing to the distance, the tall, thin larches, the
thick willows, bushes, and grass growing there
looked quite small, but the rays of the sunset,
falling on them from behind, produced a wonderful
lace-work of dark branches and leaves against
a pale-rose sky. Grey clouds hung above them,
heavily embroidered with gold and purple. The
waves sported and chased one another below on
the foam-splashed banks of the lake, which was
painted with colours from the sky.</p>

<p>I walked towards the gorge, by the footpath
leading through a meadow which was now turning
yellow.</p>

<p>That 'demons' forest'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> looked dark and horrible
close at hand. The flat hills, uniformly
covered with soft moss of a dirty green, and
with cranberry leaves, undulated gently westwards
towards the sinking sun. The wood covering
these hills was sparse and stunted, and disfigured
them rather than otherwise, for single trees stood
out here and there like the remaining hair on a
bald man's head. Silence, and the gloom of oncoming
night already filled the interior of the
forest. Only here and there a forgotten ray of
sunshine was burning itself out above in the bare,
wind-twisted summits of the larches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>I stood for a moment, looking at that wild
spot, which no native would have dared to approach.
A deep stillness lay upon it; the waves
beat more and more gently and noiselessly; the
sunset was fading away, and only where the
network of bushes was less close a transient
gleam lighted the surface of some lakes, which
had hitherto been unknown to me. I walked on
towards them, impelled by curiosity and a feeling
of longing.</p>

<p>The way proved more difficult than I had expected.
At every moment I was obliged to jump
or climb over bushes and avoid the deep, narrow
wells, boarded round with tree-trunks felled a
hundred years before and perfidiously concealed
by the mosses and plants overgrowing them. As
these wells were full of water, with bottoms as
slippery as ice, an unwary pedestrian could easily
break his neck or fracture a leg by falling into
them. In many places swampy streams trickled
along undefined channels, and though their banks
were shallow, they were boggy and difficult to
cross on account of the trunks and branches lying
in them. The wood was full of trees with projecting,
mud-covered roots, which now, when
everything was assuming an indefinite shape in
the twilight, looked twisted and monstrous. The
white patches of lichen shining in the darkness
at the foot of the trees like the immense shreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of a pall, emphasized and doubled their weird
appearance. It is, therefore, no wonder that in
the purple light of dawn, or in the moonlight,
the natives should here see the tall wood-demon's
pale face,&mdash;the Slav hunter who came from the
South and now roams near the Yakut cottages,
injuring cattle.</p>

<p>Woe to the district where his shadow passes!
Often from fifty to two hundred beasts fall dead
at one shot from those terrible Southern arms.</p>

<p>That evening, however, I met none of these
inhabitants of the wood. I also did not see the
'demons,'&mdash;the dry Tungus corpses. At one
time they were to be found here quite frequently,
and the forest takes its name from them. Shrivelled
and horrible, they usually sit somewhere
under a tree or cleft in a rock, gazing eastwards
with eye-sockets pecked by the birds. On their
knees they hold a wooden bow, or a rifle, at their
feet lies a hatchet with a broken handle, and at
their belt, inlaid with silver and beads, hangs a
broken knife in its sheath,&mdash;also broken, in order
to prevent the dead man from doing any mischief
after death. A little to one side lie scattered the
bones of the reindeer, killed on his grave, the
harness, and the small Tungus sledge. No one
ever dares to possess himself of any of these
considerably valuable articles, for punishment
threatens the foolhardy, inasmuch as he loses his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
way all day long until he returns to the same
place and restores the stolen object. Until they
give ample satisfaction, and atone to the angered
owner by a gift, obstinate people return some
thirty, even a hundred times without being able
to escape from the magic circle. It is dangerous
even to touch any of the things belonging to the
dead man, since that evokes a storm, or, at best,
a high wind. Although the kindly natives had
advised me to avoid meeting with the 'demon,'
since it brings early, and sometimes immediate
death, I was very sorry not to have seized him
red-handed that evening. However, I came to be
severely punished for this sinful wish.</p>

<p>The twilight deepened. The last purple resplendance
had already faded from the sunset, when
tired and tattered, I at last succeeded in pushing
my way through the bushes of the 'demon's
forest.' The sky was dark, and twinkling with
myriads of stars. My expedition had failed in
every respect. To complete the misfortune, the
white mists hung like muslin over the valley,
and entirely prevented me from satisfying my
curiosity. I was therefore only able to take
pleasure in the play of the moonlight.</p>

<p>It was really a beautiful view, although rather
wild and gloomy. Nearly the whole of the broad
valley, to the very edge of the wood where the
dark, bare tree-tops projected beyond the border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of mist, was filled by white balls of vapour; the
moon was moving slowly above them. Looking
for a moment into the depths of the valley, she
drew aside the floating veil, and touched the
sleeping lake below with her silvery kiss. I stood
a long while to gaze and to rest. The deep
silence, the stillness which always reigns in these
woods, the knowledge that no one but myself
was to be found in that solitude for twenty versts
round, filled me with a strange feeling of anxiety
and longing. I roused myself in order to dispel
this. It was unfortunately time to think of
returning;&mdash;no easy matter, however, for in making
my way through the wood, I had lost a clear
conception of the right track. At last I hit on
a small footpath, and decided to follow it in the
hope that it would lead me to some inhabited
spot. I had scarcely gone twenty steps before
becoming persuaded that I was not walking on
a path, but on one of the numerous tracks made
in the wood by water or animals. It was therefore
necessary to return to the place from which
I had started, for only thence could I more or less
trace the way leading in a bee-line through the
wood. But the place had disappeared; the night
had shrouded it in new and different shadows,
and the mist had drawn its silver web across it.
I walked for some time, searching in vain, and
haunted by the thought of forest madness. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
seen people brought home from the 'taiga'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> no
longer in possession of their faculties, pale and
miserable, and with the traces of terror and madness
in their eyes. These unhappy men had often
lost their way quite near houses, without seeing
them or being able to recognize the points of the
compass, although the sun was shining, and they
had wandered about, crying and howling like
wild animals. After recovering, they said that
they had seen the demon. One of the causes of
this illness is the fatigue brought on by the strain
of the vain search. So I sat down on a felled
trunk, resolving to wait for daybreak.</p>

<p>The air was cool. My clothes were wet with
the mist and rain, besides being too thin for
spending the night in the wood, so that I soon
began to suffer from the cold. I tried to light
a fire, but the matches were damp, and the only
one which burnt could not set fire to the moist
brushwood and logs. Having, therefore, gathered
some grass, I hid my feet in it, as they were
suffering the most from the cold; I examined my
gun, and loaded it, and then, crouching against
a tree, I tried to go to sleep.</p>

<p>In a situation of this kind every sense is rapidly
dulled,&mdash;touch, smell, even sight; hearing alone
becomes exceedingly acute. After only a few
minutes I could hear my heart beating, the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
pouring through my veins, the whisper of the
trees, the rustle of the mist, so that the dead
silence of the wood was broken in upon by sounds,
which, though scarcely audible, continued to increase.
Suddenly a very real sound rang out
amid these fancied ones, and forced me to open
my eyes. It came from the further end of the
lake, and was like the measured strokes of an oar.
I fixed my eyes on the spot whence it seemed to
come. The veil of mist was trembling slightly,
and beyond it, in the distance, something indistinct
appeared low on the water. After a moment
a small Yakut pirogue emerged from the shadows,
and sped along the lake. I could perfectly well see
the rower squatting in the bottom of the boat, and
striking first with one, then with the other blade
of his long oar, from the ends of which the water
poured in a shining stream, like molten silver.</p>

<p>He soon approached the bank, and drew the
boat to land. I crept towards him, hiding in
order that he should not see me too soon, and
run away, as I knew he would. He was engaged
in taking something out of the boat.</p>

<p>'What news?' I greeted him, according to the
local custom, coming slowly out of the bushes.</p>

<p>He started and exclaimed, but did not run
away, for he recognized me, and I him. He
was a poor Yakut, who lived about five versts
from me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>'I know nothing! I have heard nothing! Oh,
how you did frighten me,&mdash;but it's all right!'
he said hastily, giving me his hand.</p>

<p>'What did you think it was?'</p>

<p>'Why should one meet a man in the wood at
night time?' he answered evasively, eyeing me
suspiciously from head to foot. 'You often think
it's a man you know, and you talk to him as if
you knew him, and then it turns out in the end
not to be a man at all.'</p>

<p>'What are you doing here so late?'</p>

<p>'I am going home; it's a holiday to-morrow.
I have a long way to go from here to Babylon<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
for fishing,&mdash;thirty versts. You know we're poor
folk, we live by fishing,&mdash;we haven't any horses;
so one is always in a boat, always in a boat. As
I was dragging it through the wood I cut my
foot, so I've got behindhand.'</p>

<p>'You have cut your foot?'</p>

<p>'It isn't much, for I've stopped the bleeding.'</p>

<p>'Then perhaps it was you whistling and calling?'
I asked, remembering a strange sound I
had heard a moment before.</p>

<p>'I!&mdash;No!' He was silent, and I noticed him
lean over the boat, and cross himself.</p>

<p>'And what are you doing here?' he asked in
his turn.</p>

<p>I hesitated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>'Looking for ducks,' I lied, not wishing to
frighten him more.</p>

<p>'Ducks!' he repeated, laughing heartily, and
his white teeth shone in the darkness like pearls.</p>

<p>'There have never been any ducks here!'</p>

<p>'Never been any? Why?' I asked, as I helped
him to draw the boat along the edge of the wood
towards the lake, which could be seen in the distance.
The fisherman was limping.</p>

<p>'The lakes are different,' he explained, 'and
there are as many lakes in our country as stars
in the sky, and the stars are only the reflection
of them. The lakes are as different as the stars:&mdash;there
are large and small ones, and some so
deep that you can't reach the bottom; or else
they are shallow, or marshy. In one there are fine
fish, in another small, in some the water's bad,
and makes a man ill, because the cattle go into
it, in others again it's as pure as air.'</p>

<p>We halted on the bank, let down the boat into
the water, and entered it, the fisherman in front,
I behind. Leaning lightly against one another,
back to back, we sailed along like a god with
two faces of which one was bearded and European,
the other flat, clean-shaven, and Mongolian.</p>

<p>The Mongolian face continued its conversation,
only interrupting it now and then to give me a
warning not to move when the boat rocked too
much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>'Everything comes from the water. Even the
cow lived in the water until she was taken and
tamed by man. There are different kinds of
wild beasts and even people living in the water,
as there are on land. Now just look!' and he
pointed with his oar to the long water-weeds
swaying under the passage of the pirogue. 'Isn't
that a wood?' It was indeed a wood, dark and
mysterious, visited only by fishes and drowned
men. Once he had fallen in, no swimmer ever
extricated himself from its thickets.</p>

<p>'Old people say,' the Yakut continued, 'that
formerly everything was different,&mdash;everything
was better, because there was more water, and
that even the sables used to come up to the farm
gates, and there was so much fish that it was
enough to shoot an arrow into the lake to draw
it back with a good catch. But now there's
nothing; the sables have run away, and there
isn't much fish. It's only the traders, our fathers,
who save us, or we should die. They give the
money to pay the taxes, they give tea, tobacco,
and cotton. Eh yes! these traders! I'd just like
to be a trader!'</p>

<p>The little boat struck the bank. We therefore
drew it along to the next lake, and continued the
rest of our journey in this manner, this being the
sole means of travelling in summer in that country
of lakes, marshes, and swampy woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>After travelling thus for an hour along a
narrow stream, overgrown with bulrushes, we
ultimately arrived at the last lake. The sparks
from a yurta chimney were glittering on its bank
in the distance, like tiny red stars.</p>

<p>'I expect you are going to Chachak?' my
companion asked, when we stopped on the bank.
'I am spending the night there.'</p>

<p>I took up some of the fisherman's things, and
walked towards the yurta. I had known Chachak
for some time past already. He was a queer
man, who laughed at his own extravagances,
and frequently even shocked the feeling of the
neighbourhood. 'Chachak has made himself a
cap of a whole wolf skin!' I had been told laughingly.
'Chachak has paid the merchants only
two roubles for a brick of tea; "they would make
too much profit by three roubles," he said!'</p>

<p>'What about the merchants? Did they give it
to him?'</p>

<p>'Eh, why, his old woman gave it to them on
the sly! Why! You don't know Chachak! He
won't give three roubles;&mdash;he won't drink, and
he won't give that!'</p>

<p>Chachak had been famous in his youth as the
best hunter in the district, and wonders were
related of his prowess and skill. He preferred
bear hunting to any other, and set out to it summer
and winter with his spear and gun, killing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in the open field or lair, just as it happened. He
was as ready for such encounters as he was for
cards. Only let him hear of a bear, and from
that moment he had no peace until he had tracked
and killed it. Many a time he had been invited
to accompany hunters who had found a den with
several bears. But burning with the fever for the
chase, he had been unable to wait until morning,
and had slipped away in the grey dawn with his
faithful dog to hasten to the spot, where he was
usually to be found, pale and splashed with the
blood of the 'forest lords.' There was nothing
left for his companions to do but for each to eat
a portion of the hard heart and liver of the
vanquished, and to drink a cup of blood, shouting
the triumphant 'uch!' three times. All eyes
would be upon Chachak, who would try to appear
indifferent, although excited and feeling the just
pride of a hero. Once, moreover, he had killed
a bear with a tail, which, as everyone knows, is
not a bear, but a devil. Had he not killed the
'icy demon,' who tracked people, carried off
cattle, and whom neither bullet nor spear could
touch? Chachak himself never spoke or boasted
of his victories; he was always modest and reserved,
as befits a man who possibly knows more
than others. Since the accident which befell him
during his last hunt, however, he had been completely
changed. He had given up hunting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
playing cards, become poor, and grown morose
and strange:&mdash;he had lost his influence.</p>

<p>His yurta stood near the bank, so I quickly
found myself at its gate. A bright fire was
burning within, and voices could be heard talking.
So they were not asleep yet! I went up to the
door, and peeped through the chink. Chachak was
sitting before the fire, with his face towards me,
holding a net which he was not winding, for his
hand was stretched slightly in front of him while
he related something to the listeners gathered
round him. At his feet a small naked child
played with the brass chain of a knife hanging
in a wooden sheath sewn to his leather trousers
above the right shin. Chachak was very animated;
every now and then he bent forward
towards his listeners, and stamped his massive
heel on the clay floor of the cottage.</p>

<p>'They have a horror of horseflesh, and eat
pigs!' he was saying, 'yet a horse is a very
clean and sensible animal.'</p>

<p>'Why, yes!' his listeners assented.</p>

<p>'But pigs!&mdash;I have seen them! They're disgusting!
They've no hair! They're bare, dirty,
stupid, and bad tempered! They've enormous
mouths, thin curling tails like snakes, small eyes,
and teeth like a dog's. They're spiteful too!&mdash;When
I was at Yakutsk I had an adventure with
the pigs, and they all but ate me. There're lots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of them there. I had gone out by myself in the
early morning to finish my pipe in the passage;
everyone was still asleep, and it had only just
begun to dawn. The pigs were going round the
courtyard, squealing. I was young, and liked a
joke, so when they ran round me I shook my fist
at them. They rushed at me like mad!' He
broke off with a laugh. 'I ran along the passage,
they after me; I jumped on to a bench, and they
came grunting round me, while I kept shaking
my fist at them. Ha-ha!'</p>

<p>He spat into his hand, and stretched it out
before him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door creaked. The woman exclaimed,
the lads jumped up from the floor, the
children began to cry.</p>

<p>'Who's coming? A Russian, perhaps, and
pigs with him!' Chachak stopped talking, and
drew back his outstretched fist.</p>

<p>The entrance, as is usual in a Yakut yurta,
was behind the fireplace, the one source of light
in the evening; thus a full minute of fear and
anxious expectation passed before I entered from
the darkness. Yes, it was a 'Russian,' but a
well-known one, a friend, and, into the bargain,
without pigs!</p>

<p>Their faces brightened, and they stretched out
their hands, welcoming me warmly and frankly,
as guests are always welcomed in the North.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Chachak laughed, made room for me on the bench
before the fire, and ordered the kettle to be put
on.</p>

<p>'Tell us the news, and what is happening,'
they begged me.</p>

<p>I began to relate the local news. They all
listened attentively, although, as it turned out,
they had already long known it. The companion
of my night journey entered, and the conversation
became general. The men grouped themselves
round the table, on which Chachak's wife had
set supper for us; freshly made soup, sour milk,
and a large pile of fish, dried and smoked.</p>

<p>Chachak stood at the fire, warming his back,
and did not join in the conversation. His daughter,
a young and rather pretty girl, placed a few
white china tea-cups and saucers on the table,
and the usual Yakut entertainment began: tea
with milk and cold refreshments, followed later
by a hot supper with fish. Although the offer of
meat was very tempting, and we were rather
hungry, we were not equal to tasting all the
dishes set before us. Chachak noticed this at
once, and attacked me about it with his wonted
brusqueness.</p>

<p>'You aren't eating? You've had enough?
What's this new fashion of going to pay visits
without being hungry? You Slavs eat like birds
when you go to people's houses, but you go home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and call out: "Wife, the samovar; put the
saucepan on the fire,&mdash;I'm hungry." You're disgraceful!'</p>

<p>They all began to laugh, the old man no less
than the rest.</p>

<p>A general conversation was started, at first
about different countries and customs, but soon
reverting to burning local questions.</p>

<p>'What's wrong with Andshay? He's in trouble.
There's no trace of his boy.'</p>

<p>'None?'</p>

<p>'A pity! He was a sturdy lad!'</p>

<p>'Have they found nothing?'</p>

<p>'No. All the neighbours have been out to
search; they've searched the lakes, they've
searched the wood, they've been searching for a
whole week. But there's nothing,&mdash;nothing.'</p>

<p>'Ah!&mdash;sure to be a bear. They say one appeared
in the valley; Kecherges saw him,'
muttered the fisherman, who had arrived with me.</p>

<p>At the word, 'bear,' Chachak, who was standing
by the fire, silently playing with his fingers,
suddenly looked up. Everyone stopped talking,
and involuntarily turned towards him. His old
wife nervously tried to change the subject.</p>

<p>'A bear! Where was he seen?' Chachak asked
quickly in a low tone, sitting down on the bench.</p>

<p>'Oh! Who can tell? Perhaps it wasn't one
either,' the fisherman answered hesitatingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>'A bear,&mdash;depend upon it!' Chachak said
slowly. 'They have found neither flesh nor
clothes:&mdash;"He" usually buries the remains of his
prey in the ground,&mdash;"He" even scrapes the
blood off. That's just what "He" does. You
say Kecherges saw "Him?"' he again asked the
fisherman.</p>

<p>'Lies!' the latter answered evasively.</p>

<p>'Oh! "He"'s clever, "He"'s sly and revengeful!
Andshay must have done something
to "Him" in order to be able to boast of it, or
to have something to talk about. "He" remembers
insults a long time, that's why "He"
has carried the boy off. Although "He" lives
far away, "He" hears in the mountains and
forest quite well what we are saying here, and
understands like a man,&mdash;better than a man!
Who knows what "He" is? Skin "Him," and
you will see how like a woman "He" is. But
"He"'s revengeful,&mdash;and terribly fierce,' Chachak
added, looking down. '"He" doesn't forgive!'</p>

<p>'You Russian,'&mdash;he turned to me suddenly,&mdash;'be
ready for "Him" on the road. Take care!
Take care! Though a bear is big, "He" can go
as quietly as a shadow when "He" wants to
fall upon a man unawares. I advise you to stay
the night with us; there's no joking with
"Him"! Once I was not afraid either, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
now;&mdash;there&mdash;look!' He undid his shirt sleeve.
It was a terrible sight. The left shoulder, which,
as I had previously noticed, the old man could
make little use of, was shrunk and thin to the
elbow, like a mere bone covered with skin, and
those veins and muscles which were unscathed,
wound round the bone close to the surface. There
was a mass of white scars, crossing in different
directions.</p>

<p>'I have killed many,&mdash;many!' he continued,
'and now I know that they will eat me for it,&mdash;eat
me because I'm afraid. It happened like this.
It was rather later in the season than this; it
was freezing. I got ready my spring-gun for elk-shooting,
and God gave me one of these big
beasts. To have carted its flesh, skin, and inside
along a bad road would have needed seven or
eight horses. So I decided to build a larder on
the spot, and to lay the elk in it for a time, till
the road became frozen. I and my boy set out
early to work. The lad was lingering a little way
behind me, and I was walking quite quietly along
the road, and had just passed the willow which
grows on the hill not far from here, when "He"
came upon me. He ran towards me like a dog,
and before I could look round "He" was already
standing on his hind-legs. I reached out for my
knife, but tried in vain to drag it from the sheath.
There was a night frost, and on coming out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the house I had not wiped my knife, as I should,
after eating, so it had frozen to the sheath. It
was God's hand!&mdash;So the "Black One" knocked
me down. Finding myself overpowered, I seized
him by the throat with my right hand, and laid
the left on his jaws, and called to the boy to run
for help. The silly boy jumped on him, and&mdash;whack!&mdash;went
his pocket knife into the bear;&mdash;he
had a little knife that size,' and Chachak
measured with his finger. '"You want to eat
my father!" he shouted. The Black One was
frightened, and jumped into the bushes. But the
boy had hit me in the chest with his knife, and
I should have been killed, had it been able to
pierce the stag's hide. They could scarcely bring
me round again.'</p>

<p>'And you see from that time, when "He,"
sitting on me, looked into my eyes, my mind
has been troubled. I am afraid,' he added quietly,
'very much afraid.'</p>

<p>Not long after I took leave of my kind hosts,
and went home. The moon was shining brightly,
the mist had disappeared, and the well-known
foot-path shone white before me. I had gone
along it a thousand times without fear or thought
of evil, but this time when I neared the place
where Chachak had been attacked I involuntarily
fingered my knife-handle, and for a moment I
seemed to see the monster lying in the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the bushes, its shaggy muzzle on its outstretched
paws.</p>

<p>A few years later I heard that Chachak had
disappeared without trace in the wood: the
'forest lords' had doubtless accomplished their
revenge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<h2>IN SACRIFICE TO THE
GODS</h2>

<h3>WACŁAW SIEROSZEWSKI</h3>


<p>Close to where the river Sheroka issues from
a rocky gorge into a broad valley, there is
a wooden column, ornamented with carving. At
this column, which stands in the middle of a
small meadow near the water, the nomad Tungus
assemble annually from the neighbouring
mountains. Hundreds of reindeer in the midst of
a crowd of human beings make a charming picture
as the caravans travel thither together. When
the merry crowd enters the valley the splash of
the river is lost in a ringing echo of voices.</p>

<p>Their camp-fires, scattered in a semi-circle in
the wood at the foot of the mountains, twinkle
against the background of eternal shadows like
a shining girdle, in which the delicate spring
green and the grey diaphanous tissue of stems
and branches are interlaced.</p>

<p>This is the most agreeable season in the mountain
valleys; gnats and other insects have not
yet begun to be worrying, the air is delightfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cool, everything is unfolding and blossoming, and
only the winter snow on the summits of the
mountains lies untouched by the warmth. The
pale, transparent sky above the snow neither
darkens at night nor glitters with stars, but
shines with the Northern light which joins the
sunset of the fading day to the sunrise of the
next.</p>

<p>The people remain near the column in the clearing
for a whole week. The family elders, grave
old men, meet here and discuss their common
needs, collect the tribute of hides, and settle all
important matters.</p>

<p>But the young men use the time for love and
merry-making, dancing and races. The valley
rings with laughter and shouting, with the strokes
of the hatchet and the echoes of songs; the
ground trembles under the cloven hoofs of the
furiously driven reindeer; the leather lassoes
swish through the air as they are thrown on to
the antlers of the animals destined for slaughter.
And where work is most active, where life is at
its fullest the jingle of the women's glass and
silver ornaments is sure to be heard.</p>

<p>So it has been time out of mind. But one year
it happened differently.</p>

<p>Numbers of people assembled in the valley, as
usual, but the noise of their talking did not drown
the roar of the river. The youths did not dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
at the meeting place, no reindeer were to be seen
racing. There was no laughter, no singing.</p>

<p>Nor did the counsels take place in common.
The men assembled in small groups in separate
tents, with a dull look on their sad faces. They
talked without animation; jokes and laughter, so
beloved by the Tungus, were checked by a general
sense of depression, and only rarely indulged in.</p>

<p>However, they did not disperse, but waited
impatiently for the coming of old Seltichan, without
whom they would not have dared to have
settled any important matters. But the old man
did not arrive.</p>

<p>'The old man doesn't come, he doesn't come,&mdash;and
he won't come,' muttered one of the group,
sitting among his companions, who were circling
round the fire. He was a stout man of possibly
fifty years of age, unlike a Tungus, and dressed
like a Yakut, with a silver Yakut belt. He had
the puffed-up air of a rich man knowing his own
importance. 'Who cares to visit the dying?' he
added, sulkily.</p>

<p>'<i>You</i> didn't try to escape your fate,' gloomily
answered a poorly dressed old man, as tawny as
copper, and as wrinkled as moss, who was sitting
on the opposite side of the fire.</p>

<p>'That is true!' a third repeated. 'You don't
try to escape, you don't hide. Didn't I run away,
didn't I hide? And what came of it?' and, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
emotion, he began for the hundredth time to relate
the story of his misfortune. Each time it was
received with equal attention.</p>

<p>'When the news of the disaster came I was on
the summit of Bur-Janga, and was just getting
ready to go down; but I hesitated, and delayed
my start. For a long while the God had mercy
on me;&mdash;I know that!&mdash;till one night I awoke
terrified, with a beating heart. I listened:&mdash;I
heard what seemed like a shot, and loud calling.
I drew my head from under the cover, and again
I seemed to hear a noise in the wood, like distant
shooting. The dogs whined and howled, as if
they had noticed a bear. I went out of the tent,
and looked. The moon was shining, and an
immense shadow passed into the wood from the
bottom of the valley, avoiding the hills. The
dogs fell at my feet, and I covered my eyes with
my hand, unable to look. My heart beat in my
breast like a frightened bird, my feet were rigid
with terror.'</p>

<p>'O-oh!' echoed the sighs of the listeners.</p>

<p>'And what happened next?&mdash;A hundred reindeer
fell dead at once. Not waiting for dawn,
we pushed on that very night. We fled, not halting
anywhere, but our herds became smaller every
day. So I divided them, and sent them in three
directions; yet in a few days' time my son,&mdash;and
later my daughter,&mdash;returned empty-handed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Then I made up my mind to flee to the end of the
world, where no one ever goes. But is there a
place anywhere, to which no one has ever yet
been? I took nothing belonging to the dying
animals, not even the halters; I left everything.
And when the leader fell I did not even take the
figured band from his head, which had come down
to me from my ancestors.'</p>

<p>'A-ah!' responded the listeners.</p>

<p>'The women burst into tears at that,' he continued,
encouraged by the sympathy of his audience,
'but the Russian traders had advised it.
"Take none of His offering, Brother; He seeks
out His own, and will find it everywhere!" So
I obeyed; I left it and fled. At last I had gone
so far that I grew frightened myself:&mdash;may be
no one had ever been there before me. There
were no trees anywhere, not even bushes,&mdash;only
the same rocks and snow everywhere,&mdash;and the
gale. It was impossible to pitch a tent for want
of poles, and I was afraid to send to the wood
for them, so we dug out a hole in the snow under
a rock, and settled ourselves in it. We were
comfortable there, and began to be cheerful once
more, for the plague ceased. One day passed,&mdash;a
second,&mdash;and none of the reindeer had sickened.
We waited in the silence of fear; we not only
avoided talking, but even thinking about "Him,"
for possibly "He" too would forget us! We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
did not allow the reindeer out of our sight, and
we went where they led us, spending the night
among the herd, like the Chukchee. In this
way some time passed. My wife was already
beginning to be cheerful, and I myself thought
that all would be well, and we should grow richer
after a while. But again I suddenly awoke in the
night, torn by anxiety. The moon was shining
as on that other night, and everything was bright
and still all round. The tired reindeer were sleeping
in a heap in the snow. But a shadow hung
in the air, falling independently, and not from a
rock.'</p>

<p>Again the listeners responded with sighs.</p>

<p>'I slipped out of bed cautiously, took my gun,
and without dressing, began to steal, naked, towards
"Him." "He" did not notice me, for
"He" was standing on a rock, taking stock of
what I possessed. But when I made a slight
sound as I was hurriedly taking aim, "He"
turned and fixed "His" great burning eyes on
me. I shot between them. What happened
afterwards I do not know. Did "He" hit me,
or cover me with "His" breath? I have no idea.</p>

<p>'Something like a storm passed over me; but
when I regained consciousness I had not a single
reindeer left;&mdash;Tumara was a poor man.'</p>

<p>The speaker was silent, waved his hand, and
starting to his feet, stood with bowed head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
an expression of pain on his face. The young
men in the audience also stood up; but the old
men did not stir from their seats, and fixing
their eyes on the speaker, waited for the continuation
of the story.</p>

<p>'Well,&mdash;and then&mdash;?'</p>

<p>Tumara raised his head and began to speak,
but at that moment his look fell beyond the edge
of the circle and became absorbed in the distance,
his face showed astonishment, his lips trembled,
and tears rolled from his eyes. Everyone at once
turned in the same direction.</p>

<p>At some distance from the fire, and leaning
against the back of a reindeer as white as milk,
stood a grey-headed Tungus in the old-time national
costume. Behind him, holding a riding-reindeer
by the bridle, was a young boy resembling
him in face and dress.</p>

<p>'Seltichan!' they all cried, 'you have come at
last,&mdash;you!&mdash;our father! We thought that you
had forsaken us, who are dying! What news?
What have you heard and seen beyond the mountains?
How fare the people of Memel? Are they
living still? Or are they, perhaps, also drawing
their last breath, as we are? And you, our leader,
what do you mean to do? Have you come alone,
or with all your people? Are you going back to
the mountains? Or are you going to the coast?'
The questions came pouring out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Giving the bridle to his son, Seltichan joined
the circle round the fire, and greeted everyone
singly by a shake of the hand. He sat down
beside the Kniaź,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> dressed like a Yakut, who
hastily made room for him. Then, pulling a
small Chinese pipe out of his tobacco-pouch, he
filled it slowly. The group became silent, and
sat down again.</p>

<p>'It is now two months since the plague reached
its height,' the old man answered in a calm, grave
voice. 'The people of Memel have dispersed
terrified and fled to the coast, but by different
ways, in order to avoid the dangerous place.
You need not expect them here. But my camp
will arrive this evening.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Seltichan, who would ever doubt that
you would come? You are wise, you are daring,
you, we know, fear nothing!' the Kniaź cried,
stretching out his hand towards his neighbour's
lighted pipe.</p>

<p>A shadow stole over the old man's face.</p>

<p>'No one can escape his fate,' he replied coldly.</p>

<p>'But you were born to happiness, Seltichan!
Does not the God love you? When whole herds
were dying everywhere, did you not merely lose
a young calf?'</p>

<p>Again a cloud came over the old man's face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>'He loves me because I keep the ancient customs.
My welfare does not spring from human
tears, but the mountains, the rocks, the woods,
and water bring it me,' the old man remarked
drily.</p>

<p>His hearers caught up his words.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed! Your hand was open; you
supported your people in the day of disaster, and
shared in it.'</p>

<p>'Yet who can help more easily than you?' said
the Kniaź. 'What can I give, for example, I,
who have only goods for sale, and debts? Should
I distribute my debts in these hard times? It is
true, I have nothing against that! Yet I too am
a Tungus;&mdash;what would anyone gain from my
accursed debts? They don't breed reindeer,' he
ended, laughing.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed! We should die without you,
Seltichan! Who supports us? Whose herds are
larger than yours? Who has a better heart?
What family is more distinguished and richer?
Whose sons are more skilled shots, and finer
huntsmen? Whose daughters, when grown-up,
most attract our youths? Are you not the first
among us,&mdash;you who neither suffer nor fear,
never lie, and never deceive as we do, and bow to
your fate? You, Seltichan! And to whom shall we
go, if you will not have pity on us?' came from
all sides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>'The God knows, I will share with you! That
is why I am here!' the old man answered,
touched.</p>

<p>'Tumara! Tumara!' the Kniaź cried, seeking
the story-teller, 'finish your tale. You will see,
Seltichan, what happens later.'</p>

<p>Silence prevailed again. Tumara, who was
sitting in the front row of the councillors, stroked
his right ear with his right hand, and began after
a moment's pause.</p>

<p>'I have told you already how, having lost the
reindeer, we took our goods and our children on
our backs, and returned to the valley. Our children
became ill, and soon died from eating bad
meat, which made us weak too. But what can
a hunter find in the wilderness at a time like
that?'</p>

<p>'What, indeed?'</p>

<p>'Very soon we were entirely without food. We
had eaten all our stores, leather bags, and old
thongs, and the women's greasy scarves; there
was nothing left that could have a taste. Do not
we, who encamp on the mountains, know what
hunger is? And was Tumara wanting in courage?'</p>

<p>'He was famous for it!' the listeners
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'asserverated'">asseverated</ins>.</p>

<p>'But it happened thus, nevertheless;&mdash;we had
been many, and only four were left,&mdash;I, my wife,
my son, and daughter. We went on, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
longing for the sight of human faces. We halted
at all the known spots and ancient resting places,
and everywhere found the cold ashes of fires:&mdash;the
people had fled, scattered by the danger. And
our wanderings took us ever further from them.</p>

<p>'But when, on coming down from the mountains,
we saw bare tent poles, all our courage
forsook us. Notwithstanding, we went on further
and never stopped searching, for it is not an easy
thing for a man to lie down and die in the snow
without giving any account of himself.&mdash;We
scraped the rubbish, and turned over the wet
ashes of the cold fires to find a morsel of food,
stilling our hunger by knawing the bones left by
the dogs. At last it came to this that we could
not look at our own children, full of flesh and
warm blood, without trembling. "Tumara, let
the girl die to save her parents," my wife said at
last. I was sorry for the child. She looked at
us, not understanding. "Tala," her mother said
to her, "according to the old custom, when the
family is in danger, the daughter dies first."'</p>

<p>'That is so!' the listeners affirmed.</p>

<p>'"Go, Tala," she said, "wash in the snow,
and look at the world for the last time." The
girl understood and tried to escape, but I held
her; so she cried and begged: "Wait till the
evening, perhaps the God will send something, I
want to live; I am afraid!" So we waited and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
watched. The girl was continually going out of
the tent, and looking towards the wood, shading
her eyes with her hand. But each time her
mother was behind her, hiding a knife in her
sleeve. It had already begun to be dusk. The
girl went out oftener and each time stood longer
on the threshold, while I lay in the shade of the
tent, waiting to see what would happen. Suddenly
I heard a cry outside, which froze my heart.
My wife came in with the knife in her hand,
staggering like a drunken woman. "Have you
killed her?" "No, the God has had pity," she
said, "there is a large elk running into the wood
close by here!" I jumped up and ran out of the
door with my son. The girl was sitting by the
tent with outstretched arms, while not far off
in the wood stood a large elk.&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stood a large elk!' the listeners repeated.</p>

<p>'Is it difficult for a hunter to kill an animal
grazing? But my limbs were dried up with hunger,
my muscles weak with pain, and as I stole
towards my prey my hands shook so much I
could scarcely keep the gun in my hands. But
when the animal had been hit, and tried to escape
into the bushes, we dashed after it like wolves.
And thus the God helped us;&mdash;we remained alive
in order to die to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Tumara ceased speaking, and bowed his head,
again stroking his right ear with his right hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
The listeners were silent. In that moment of
strained attention they seemed to hear the splash
of each individual wave in the river, the swish of
each branch in the wood, as it rocked in the gale.
Suddenly another sound rang out distinct from
these continuous sounds, making all faces
brighten, and all heads turn in the direction
whence it came.</p>

<p>Young Miore, Seltichan's son, bent down to
his father, and whispered:</p>

<p>'Father, our people are coming!'</p>

<p>'Yes, they are coming!'</p>

<p>The train was actually approaching.</p>

<p>The old men remained seated, but the young
ones slipped out of the circle one after another,
and assembled in groups at the edge of the bushes,
whence the whole procession, appearing at the
rocky outlet to the valley, could be better seen.</p>

<p>A young girl rode in front on a dark yellow
reindeer. Her clothes were richly ornamented
with silver, a fact which at once suggested that
she was a great favourite in her family. She
held a long spear in her hand, and wore a band,
embroidered with beads, on her loose hair. As
she rode along, she cleared her path by cutting
away the twigs and gnarled branches which
might catch from behind on the packsaddle or
her clothing. When she raised her spear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sunbeams played on the edge of its steel surface
in a fiery gleam, and hovered over her head for
a moment like a will-o'wisp; then, passing along
her shining silver scarf, they fell on her right
hand, and finally faded away in the grass of the
river-islands.</p>

<p>'Choka! Chogai!' the charming girl exclaimed.
She was accompanied by two black dogs, which
kept running ahead, and then turning back to
examine and sniff at everything, leaving nothing
unnoticed. Following her in a long line came
the laden reindeer, some of which were being
ridden by women, and children who were tied on
to the top like tight bundles.</p>

<p>At the very end of the caravan two armed
huntsmen, aided by dogs, drove a herd of unladen
reindeer with their calves. The noise,
clatter, and bustle, the frightened calling of the
cows seeking their calves which had gone astray
in the confusion, the jingle of bells, the rattle of
clappers hanging from the necks of the animals
in front, the cries of the men calling to the herd
or keeping it in order,&mdash;all this whirlpool of
seething, exuberant life filled the valley with a
resounding echo, and fell on the ear of the listener
as a great familiar song of the happiness and
well-being of a free nomad existence.</p>

<p>The spectators' eyes glistened. Unable to restrain
an outburst of feeling, they began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
describe the impressions made upon them by the
scenes and faces passing by like fleeting shadows.</p>

<p>'See, there is old Nioren!'</p>

<p>'What an energetic old woman!'</p>

<p>'Formerly all the Tungus women were like
that.'</p>

<p>'So they say&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Look how cleverly she manages her reindeer.'</p>

<p>'That's one good thing, but they say that she
bore a son to Seltichan not long ago, and that's
better still.'</p>

<p>'There's nothing wonderful in that; Majantylan's
wife is older, and she also bore&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush! Look, there is Sala, the old man's
daughter-in-law, about whom they sing songs.'</p>

<p>'But is she not worthy of them?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed!'</p>

<p>'You may chatter away, but if Miore hears
you, he will give it you!'</p>

<p>'What can he do to us? I am not afraid of
him.'</p>

<p>'Look,&mdash;look!&mdash;Laubzal!&mdash;Zleci!'</p>

<p>'Actually!&mdash;What a wild reindeer!&mdash;They
needn't have put a little boy on it!'</p>

<p>'He's a plucky lad! Look!&mdash;The old man
will be delighted with him!'</p>

<p>'And Chun-Me!'</p>

<p>'Ah! Chun-Me! Chun-Me!' several sighed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
their glances seeking the girl with the steel-coloured
fringe on her head.</p>

<p>'They say that the Kniaź wants to win her
for his son.'</p>

<p>'Eh, the old man won't give him his favourite
daughter,&mdash;not he!'</p>

<p>When Seltichan's eldest son rode by,&mdash;a famous
hunter, commonly known by the name of 'Sparkling
Ice,'&mdash;conversation was hushed out of respect
to him.</p>

<p>And when the last reindeer of the caravan had
disappeared into the bushes, and the branches
closed swinging behind it, Seltichan rose from
his seat and went away, taking leave of the company
with a slight nod. This was to indicate
that he was expecting them all to come to him
shortly.</p>

<p>That evening there was a crowd round the old
man's tent, for nearly all the temporary inhabitants
of the valley were present. The host gave
orders for several reindeer to be killed, and
welcomed his guests. With the light-heartedness
of true Tungus, they forgot their sufferings in
satisfying their hunger after their long fast, and
began to dance and join in cheerful songs.</p>

<p>The old men sitting by the fire watched the
younger ones with enjoyment, and beat time
with their heads, repeating the refrains.</p>

<p>'What do you think, Oltungaba, will the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
withdraw his punishing hand, and allow joy to
return to the mountains?' Seltichan asked, turning
to one of the guests, the old man who was
as dark as copper, and as wrinkled as moss.</p>

<p>'Our life, Seltichan, is a shadow falling upon
the water,' Oltungaba answered meditatively.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The following morning the people in the valley
awoke in an unusually solemn mood. The day
proclaimed itself rich in events. The weather
was exquisite, the sky clear and blue, without
a trace of cloud.</p>

<p>Having assembled at the conference, the older
and prominent members of families took their
places in the front row, the younger ones behind
them, and the women and children still further
off, beyond the edge of the circle. Oltungaba,
yielding to numerous entreaties, walked into the
centre, and bowing, said:</p>

<p>'Why do you ask this of me, regardless of my
old age?'</p>

<p>'To whom else can we turn?'</p>

<p>'There are distinguished shamans who are
younger.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Oltungaba, who would dare to prophesy
in your presence?' was asked from all sides.</p>

<p>The old man was silent, and looked distrustingly
at the excited assembly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>'You hesitate,&mdash;when, maybe, the last day has
come for many?'</p>

<p>'I am not thinking of myself, but calling to
mind the ancient customs. Who will interpret
my language to you? A difficult time demands a
difficult language, and a painful time a painful
language. And why arouse danger unnecessarily?
If no brave man is found, must I die?'</p>

<p>'Let us all die! Surely, Oltungaba, you wish
us well? We are resolved.'</p>

<p>'Then <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'let is'">let it</ins> be so,' he assented, after a short
moment's thought.</p>

<p>Two of the most famous shamans offered him
a shaman's cloak with the long fringe, and a
number of metal amulets and musical instruments.
Then they smoothed out the old man's hair, and
placed a horned iron crown on his head. An
elderly Tungus, in attendance on the shaman,
was drying a drum at the fire meanwhile. When
perfectly dry and taut, he tested its elasticity by
a blow with a small mallet. The well-known
mournful sound stirred the echoes of the valley,
and interrupted the talking. A white reindeer
skin, with the head turned towards the south,
was then spread in the middle of the circle. The
old man sat down on it, and lighting his pipe,
swallowed the smoke, and washed it down with
water. Then he poured out the rest of the water
to the four quarters of the globe, and turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
his face to the sun, fell into a state of complete
torpor. He sat thus for a long while with bowed
head, his hair falling into his eyes, and his look
fixed on the blinding white of the mountain tops.
At length a shiver ran through his body, followed
by a violent sob. The shivering and sobs increased
by degrees until they passed into incessant convulsions
and groans, in part feigned, in part real.
The spectators could be heard sobbing also.</p>

<p>An old woman dropped down in a fit.</p>

<p>At the same moment a fleeting, dark shadow
fell on the ground close to the shaman: an eagle
was hovering between him and the sun. A
piercing cry rent the air, and the people bent
like grass before the gale.</p>

<p>Who cried? The shaman or the eagle?</p>

<p>No one knew.</p>

<p>'It is bad, it is bad,' the people murmured.</p>

<p>'Hush!'</p>

<p>The drum sounded several times with a deep
and mournful echo, as the crowd was frightened
into silence.&mdash;The eagle flew away into the
distance.</p>

<p>Once more there was stillness, interrupted only
by the shaman's muttering. After a while isolated
sounds, coming, as it seemed, from the distant
wood and depths of the mountain clefts, began
to mingle, like the murmur of a swarm of bees,
or the twitter of birds calling to one another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Then Oltungaba shook his bells. By degrees
these sounds grew louder, and came nearer, until
they passed away in the roar of the waterfall
and the splash of the rain which was now falling
in torrents. Yet deep and painful sighs, repeated
more and more frequently, could be heard above
the rush of the water. Oltungaba suddenly raised
the drum above his head. Trembling violently,
and covered with the pelting hail, he began to
utter frightened sounds, like a sheep chased by
a wolf. Then, all at once, throwing his hand
into the soft reindeer skin, he became silent, but
continued to tremble.</p>

<p>'Oh, Goloron!' the shaman groaned, hiding
his face with his hands.</p>

<p>And there was stillness once more. Nothing
was heard but the shaman's sobs and indistinct
mutterings, accompanied by the beating of the
drum. Above these sounds rose the intermingled
cries of eagles, hawks, crows, and lapwings,
which appeared to be circling in flights round the
mountain tops. Their shrieking and cawing alternated
with the shaman's unintelligible incantations.
It almost seemed as if they foresaw some
dreadful event, and were hastening to bring news
of it in advance to the lords of the äerial world.</p>

<p>By degrees the incantations became more distinct,
the words more intelligible, till finally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
first strophe of a chant burst from the shaman's
lips.</p>

<p>'Do ye hear the roar of the sea?'</p>

<p>'Ah yes!' answered the attendant.</p>

<p>'I who am the first in creation&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Verily,' the attendant replied.</p>

<p>'I, the first among the chosen&mdash;'</p>

<p>'In truth,' the attendant repeated.</p>

<p>'Let them come blazing, like the shield of the
sun!'</p>

<p>'Let them come!'</p>

<p>'He himself like the clouds,&mdash;the fiery raven
precedes him&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Riddles for a child!'</p>

<p>'Riddles for a child!'</p>

<p>'I am thy son. I, wretched one, walking the
earth, implore thee!'</p>

<p>'I implore!'</p>

<p>'Aid my weak strength in this stony path.'</p>

<p>'Oh, aid!'</p>

<p>'Oh, drum, my herald, and wind, my wings!'</p>

<p>'Aye, verily&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I approach you, encircled by winged and
restless&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Winged and restless&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Their claws are open, their throats are extended&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Extended&mdash;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>'The mountains groan, the earth trembles
within&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah!&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And I go ever fearfully, yet unhindered&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Protect me, my lord, I cry to thee&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For I am from the suffering nation!'</p>

<p>'I am indeed.'</p>

<p>'Mighty helper, angry, threatening saviour,
have pity!'</p>

<p>'We pray!&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If I err, let me not perish on the pathless
track!'</p>

<p>'Let me not!'</p>

<p>'Save the erring, lead me.'</p>

<p>'We go&mdash;'</p>

<p>Growing more and more animated, the old man
stood up, and began to dance.</p>

<p>The dance resembled a march. The shaman
described what he met in his path in fantastic
language, and by gestures. The attendant followed
him, repeating his words, and, at moments,
supporting him by the elbow. Thus they came
to the edge of the circle. Calmly and solemnly
the shaman raised his drum towards the sky in
silence, and then sang:</p>

<p>'Thou snake-like Etygar, dwelling in regions
below the earth, ruling over the air, sickness,
and death itself.&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, Etygar!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>'And thou, Iniany, like to a man with huge
wings, thou, who shelterest from destruction&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Iniany!'</p>

<p>'And thou, Arkunda, endued with the power
of second-sight!'</p>

<p>'And thou, Normandaï, whose piercing cry
turns the heart to ice!'</p>

<p>'And thou, iron-feathered Wavadabaki! And
thou, whom we only know by thy shadow!&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I ask what you may require, and what is the
cause of your anger? Restrain your ministers,
withhold your persecutions. Know ye not that
we perish, and if we perish, who will prepare
your offering?'</p>

<p>'Who will?'</p>

<p>'To you I come defenceless, entangled in a
long cloak. My head is bent with years, my open
eyes cannot see far.'</p>

<p>'It is even so!' chimed in the attendant, who
had been silent hitherto, not daring to repeat all
these awful incantations.</p>

<p>'Going to the sea, and returning to the sea,
I am a Nomad&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yea, verily&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ye like dark reindeer, ye like dappled reindeer;
have they ceased to be pleasing?'</p>

<p>'Have they ceased?'</p>

<p>'Ha! Ha! Ha! When you dance, do you
forget us, and being merry, do you shun us?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>'Is it, perhaps, rich furs, silver, glass ornaments,
coloured dresses, sweet cakes, or vodka
that you desire?'</p>

<p>'That cannot be!' exclaimed the attendant.</p>

<p>'Fools! Something, were it even everything,
must be taken for the powerful!'</p>

<p>'Therefore choose a young girl from among us,
and we will dedicate her.'</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>'Oh, fiery Goloron, feared on the earth, proclaiming&mdash;'</p>

<p>Again there was silence.</p>

<p>Oltungaba beat the drum, and the strokes
rolled like thunder between the awful words,
which, uttered haltingly, seemed to come from
a distance.</p>

<p>'They give the scraps to the dogs! Let the
people humble themselves, and an obedient man
be found; otherwise they will fade like the morning
mist.'</p>

<p>'O-oh! How can we possibly give anything,
possessing nothing?'</p>

<p>'I will therefore tell you how it was in former
days. Let it be he who is proud, he who is rich,
whose sons are famed for their shooting, and
daughters for their beauty; whom all love, whose
thoughts are kind, and counsels wise, whose heart
is brave, whose hand is open, whose soul seeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
good. We wish to see the bewildered terror, the
pale face, the tears of separation.'</p>

<p>Oltungaba became silent, and let the drum fall.</p>

<p>'No!' he said, after a moment's reflection, 'I
will not disclose the name; possibly they may
say; "Oltungaba is jealous." Yet what is
human blood to me? A shaman needs nothing
but his drum.&mdash;I have said everything.'</p>

<p>He concluded the rest of the ceremony rapidly,
and took his place among the spectators, gloomy
and exhausted. Tea was offered to him and the
more honoured guests. The young men began to
kill reindeer for the others, and to put the cauldron
on the fire without delay. Yet none of this was
accompanied by the gaiety and animation which
usually prevails among the Tungus on such
occasions. Those present talked with great
restraint, lowering their voices almost to a whisper.
They behaved with marked politeness to
the family of Seltichan, and took pains not even
to look at their host.</p>

<p>Seltichan was as calm and friendly as usual, as
if he had not noticed anything, and even tried to
start a conversation with Oltungaba. But the
shaman preserved a gloomy silence. Then Seltichan
began to relate aloud how he had spent that
year beyond the mountains, throwing in various
hunting anecdotes which he told with so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
humour that he was soon surrounded by cheered
and even smiling faces.</p>

<p>Only his favourite son, Miore, who was standing
behind him, looked gloomily at everyone.</p>

<p>The frame of mind usual before a meal slowly
gained the ascendancy. And when the pieces of
savoury meat were taken from the cauldron,
everyone had quite forgotten to be sad. Then
Seltichan, forsaken by his listeners, became depressed
at once, and Miore, watching his father
attentively, grew gloomier still.</p>

<p>Unable to restrain himself longer, the lad burst
forth angrily to Oltungaba, as he approached: 'I
can see that you really want to make away with
the old man.'</p>

<p>The latter regarded him with angry surprise.</p>

<p>'You are young and ignorant&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But nothing shall come of this,' Miore
answered, and withdrew, shaking his head.</p>

<p>This short conversation did not escape other
people's attention.</p>

<p>By the end of the banquet Seltichan had regained
his usual amiability, as became a host who
was entertaining the second day running without
regard to his herds. But on returning to his tent
he no longer concealed his anxiety, and sat meditatively
before the fire, paying no heed to anything;
he did not even see the supper his wife placed
before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>'Eat, Seltichan; do not grieve, my lord; I am
your faithful servant!' she said at last, shaking
him by the shoulder and looking at him affectionately.</p>

<p>The old man turned enquiringly towards his
wife, and smiled. He ate heartily and with relish,
for, according to Tungus ideas, no event in life
is great enough to deprive a fat reindeer of its
savouriness.</p>

<p>The following morning Seltichan awoke earlier
than the rest, and possibly for the first time since
becoming head of the family, he did not stir the
half-extinguished fire, but, without waking anyone,
quietly escaped from the tent.</p>

<p>The sun was shining, although it had not yet
risen above the mountains. The dawn had disappeared,
and it was broad daylight. Here and
there golden lines bordered the blue shadows of
the clefts in the snow-clad mountains. But meanwhile
in the valleys, man and Nature were still
asleep:&mdash;the wood slept, wreathed in mist; the
embers glowed faintly on the cool hearths; the
reindeer lay on the moss in the bushes, chewing
the cud. The only sounds were the gurgle of the
river, and the chuckle of the mountain pheasants,
which were leaving their hidden roosting places,
and flying to the tree tops.</p>

<p>The old man gazed at the familiar valley long
and attentively. Suddenly he trembled. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
see a man standing before one of the tents in
the distance; he also seemed to be looking at
the surrounding country. Seltichan's keen glance
recognized Oltungaba, but the tent, before which
he was standing, belonged to the Kniaź. The
old man's face clouded, and he went home.</p>

<p>'Get up, children!' he cried. 'Heh! Chun-Me!
light the fire! You've had enough sleep for
a day like this!'</p>

<p>They all sprang up frightened, and began to
busy themselves. The old man looked on with
pleasure while the work was silently shared in
the order established by centuries. The women
put the tea-kettle and cauldron on the fire, and
carried the bedding out of doors; the men, after
examining their thongs and arms, prepared to go
into the wood to call the herd together. The
bustle stopped when the tea was ready. They all
sat down gravely round a plank serving as table,
but as the host was silent, no one dared to talk,
although all, not excepting old Nioren, were
excited. The young women and girls looked at
their father in unspeakable fear. Miore was sad
and angry, but 'Sparkling Ice' regarded the old
man with respect, not unmixed with a certain
degree of curiosity.</p>

<p>After drinking his tea, Seltichan ate something,
and lighted his pipe. Then he said to his youngest
son:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>'Go out, boy, and call the people.'</p>

<p>Miore did not stir from his seat.</p>

<p>'Do you hear?'</p>

<p>Not until the command had been repeated
threateningly did the lad rise and begin to buckle
on his things. But, instead of going, he suddenly
threw himself at his father's feet.</p>

<p>'Are you determined? Are you determined?
Oh, father do not leave us! The family will never
agree to it. I was talking to the young men
yesterday, and they said: "Rather than that, let
all our reindeer die, and we will live by industry."
But if they do decide on that in the end,&mdash;let the
fat Kniaź be killed!'</p>

<p>'You are foolish, my boy,' the old man said
with a smile. 'You do not know yet what I
shall do. I wish to see the people.&mdash;Go, I tell
you!'</p>

<p>'Oh, my lord, why do you deceive us with
hope?'</p>

<p>'Don't talk nonsense.&mdash;I have already told
you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They will never let us off; it would be better
to escape secretly.'</p>

<p>'I have already told you&mdash;' the old man repeated
obstinately.</p>

<p>'Oh Father, let us escape, let us escape!' they
all begged, stretching out their hands towards
him. But the old man thrust away Miore, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
most impetuous of them all, with a kick in the
chest, and cried:</p>

<p>'Cursed birds of ill-omen, cease from breaking
my heart!'</p>

<p>'I would like to know,' said 'Sparkling Ice,'
who had been gloomy and silent hitherto, 'why
Miore does not obey when our father commands
him?'</p>

<p>The lad, who was lying as he had fallen, rose,
and left the tent in silence.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Once more the people, from small to great, were
assembled at the column in the valley. The
armed men were dressed in their best attire,&mdash;various
kinds of fur, which hung in long fringes.
The sun shone on their ornaments as they took
their seats in small bands according to families.
They amused themselves, wrestled, and in no way
betrayed the reason for coming there.</p>

<p>The members of Seltichan's family were distinguished
among the rest by their choice arms and
rich clothing, as well as by their strength, skill,
and the proud independance of their bearing.
Seltichan himself, who occupied the seat of honour
among them, watched everything that took place
with great attention.</p>

<p>'The tribe is enfeebled, and dying out,' he said
from time to time. 'Was it not so with the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of Tumara? Where is Leljel, who was no less
flourishing than we? Where is Nilken?'</p>

<p>'If you leave us, we also shall be enfeebled
and dispersed,' his family answered him.</p>

<p>'"Sparkling Ice" will remain after me;&mdash;he is
not my son, but my comrade!'</p>

<p>The grief of Seltichan's family on hearing this
made the old man hesitate as he looked at them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the excitement prevailing in the
assembly increased, and strange rumours were
whispered abroad. Somehow it came about that
the members of Seltichan's family became more
and more isolated from the rest, and were greeted
with silence when they approached. Miore and
some of the other young men were not disconcerted
by this, however, and continued to mix
freely with the crowd.</p>

<p>In the evening they all dispersed, but the excitement
did not die down, and was only transferred
to the tents and the camp fires. People sat talking
in low voices until late into the night, alarmed
when they saw anything unusual. Several even
sharpened their spears. 'A man like that does
not die without something happening,' they said.</p>

<p>On the third day they all came fully armed.
Many of the young warriors brought their spears
with them, and stood leaning on them outside the
circle. The deliberations did not begin, but the
excited whispers which passed round the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
showed the passionate, though restrained, feeling.
All eyes were continually turned towards Seltichan,
who was sitting splendidly dressed among
his sorrowing family, he alone calm and cheerful.</p>

<p>'Shall we allow the old man to cheat us?'
whispered several.</p>

<p>'Shall we allow the old man to cheat us?' asked
the Kniaź, going from one to the other.</p>

<p>'Well, and what then?' they asked him at one
meeting. 'Perhaps you think it will be easier to
get hold of the daughter when the old man is not
there? You need not expect it; "Sparkling Ice"
will never give her to you. He has not forgotten
that little affair.'</p>

<p>'What affair? May all my reindeer die, and
may I stay in one place to the end of my life,
like a Russian in a wooden house, if that is true,'
swore the Kniaź. 'Oltungaba is not a man of
that sort!'</p>

<p>'Oltungaba drinks vodka!'</p>

<p>The Kniaź became confused, and did not know
what to answer at once. 'Idiots!' he finally
exclaimed, and stroking both ears, he ran off to
carry his complaints elsewhere.</p>

<p>All this increased the excitement, and caused
a great deal of talk, which ultimately reached
Miore's ears through Seltichan's kinsmen.
'Father, they are deceiving you,' the youth exclaimed
passionately, going up to him. 'You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
willing to die, but it is all the doing of the Kniaź;
he has bribed Oltungaba! He thinks there will be
no one to equal him when you are not here!
Father, I beg you, escape quietly. Our tents are
struck, the young men are ready, the reindeer
saddled; we shall be on the mountains before
they have noticed anything. And even should
they do so, are we not your children?'</p>

<p>Seltichan's face clouded.</p>

<p>'Let Oltungaba be summoned,&mdash;let him be
tried!' he cried, rising.</p>

<p>'Oltungaba! Oltungaba!' exclaimed many of
Seltichan's family.</p>

<p>'Oltungaba! Oltungaba!' was heard on all
sides.</p>

<p>The grey-haired old man entered the circle
reluctantly, looking as dark as moss.</p>

<p>'Is it true that you have taken a bribe from the
Kniaź? That out of regard to him you have
deceived us?' they all cried.</p>

<p>'Wait a little; let one speak! Don't you see
that I have only two ears, so that a hundred voices
only bewilder me?'</p>

<p>'Then let one speak!'</p>

<p>The head of one of the most distinguished
families, who was very highly respected, stepped
forward, and sitting down, began to ask questions.</p>

<p>'Did you take bribes?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why shouldn't I take them? Don't I live on
men's bounty? Haven't both you and Seltichan
given me some too? The Kniaź also gave one,
but he didn't ask for anything, and I promised
him nothing. Is it not a sin to suspect it? How
is it possible to say such a thing? The man will
die! Ask his people.'</p>

<p>Witnesses were summoned, and the Kniaź was
summoned. They all stood in the centre of the
angry circle, looking rather frightened, but the
enquiry led to nothing. The only thing that was
clear was that Oltungaba had visited the Kniaź
in his tent, as he had visited others, and had
profitted by his liberality.</p>

<p>Stroking his ears with both hands, and swearing
with quite unusual fervour, the Kniaź talked at
extraordinary length of his disinterestedness, his
merits, his zeal in safeguarding the interests of
the tribe with the government, and, above all, of
his sacrifices&mdash;in paying taxes.</p>

<p>Oltungaba spoke scornfully, and in monosyllables.</p>

<p>'You don't believe me, Seltichan,' he said
finally, turning to the old man. 'Have you forgotten
how I loved and taught you when you were
a boy; how I advised you in difficulties, told you
old legends, and about distant countries? Was I
not your father's comrade,&mdash;his friend when you
were still a little child, crawling on the ground?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
And later, when you grew up, did I not boast of
you, and you, did you not listen to my advice?
Who was the foremost warrior and hunter among
us? Who spoke wisely and courteously?&mdash;You
were always a true Tungus, Seltichan; we all
know that.&mdash;Was it the worst who were offered
in olden times? I swear to you, old man, and to
all the tribes that I spoke the truth. I said what
a voice from heaven commanded me to say! May
my face be turned round to my back, and my body
dried up like tobacco leaves, may my eyes fall out,
and my muscles grow weak like badly dried yarn,
and&mdash;may my hand burn, as the heart burns from
unkindness'&mdash;here with a rapid movement he put
his hand into the flame.</p>

<p>They all sprang up, and Seltichan drew the
old man away from the fire.</p>

<p>'Oltungaba, forgive me, and all of you, forgive
me,' he said with emotion. 'It is a sin to suspect
evil. I will go,&mdash;I had already determined to do
so. I am summoned, and I will go. If I stayed,
you would be forced to go,&mdash;so would it be worth
while? There is always one rotten egg in a nest.&mdash;Can
a man be a man without reindeer? What is
a Tungus without other Tungus?&mdash;I leave you,
but you will not forget me!&mdash;Good-bye!&mdash;May
your herds increase! May your children grow to
manhood! May joy not shun your tents! May
there be no lack of food in your cauldrons, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
powder in your horns, and of goodness in your
hearts!&mdash;I go away, but my thoughts are gentle,
as the rays of the setting sun.&mdash;I am going now;
I take leave of you, my people!&mdash;Farewell!'</p>

<p>With a quick movement he tore the figured
'dalys' on his chest, and plunged a knife up to
the hilt into his heart.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, his fading glance
passing round them all,&mdash;then staggered, and fell.</p>

<p>A single great sigh burst from the crowd.</p>

<p>Oltungaba hastily knelt down beside the dying
man, uncovered his breast, and placing his right
hand near the wound, stretched his left towards
the sun, crying:</p>

<p>'Oh, thou God ruling all things, help us,&mdash;shield
us! We are not the last, and not the lowest,
if we can send forth hearts like these!'</p>

<p>'Hearts like these!' groaned the crowd.</p>

<p>All, even the stout Kniaź, felt at that moment
as if their hearts beat with the same readiness
for sacrifice as that which was growing cold under
Oltungaba's hand.</p>

<p>'He was a warrior,' whispered the shaman
after a moment, and picking up the 'dalys,' he
threw it over the face, quivering in its death
agony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
